ACT ONE
Scene 1


(LUGH, the Irish god of the sun and wisdom, enters to address the audience.) 


LUGH
Thousands of years ago, in ancient Ireland, not too long after gods and monsters still walked those emerald shores... Well, there are many stories I could tell you from my memory, ones that you could have heard as mortals used to pass them down through the ages. But the world started to forget. 


(Reveal a blacksmith’s dwelling as SETANTA, a teenage boy holding a hurling stick, enters and stands in front of it to keep guard.) 


LUGH
There was one hero who most of all wanted to be remembered, who gave up everything, who took on a curse and fought against all odds just to be called a hero. But now? He might as well be right back where he started. Unpopular, ungrateful for what little he does have, and dreaming of the day he might be celebrated like the gods and heroes of his time. 


(LUGH exits. SETANTA begins to pace around. A few villagers enter to pass by. He points the hurley at them and glares. They hurry away and exit. He relaxes again.) 


#1 CU CHULAINN
	

SETANTA
I'LL ADMIT THAT THIS ISN'T QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED
YOU'D THINK THE SON OF A GOD WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE RESPECTED
I WISH MY POWERS INCLUDED CONTROLLING WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF ME
I LONG TO BE A HERO BUT ALL I GET IS INFAMY


MY LIFE AS IT IS ISN’T ALL THAT GLORIOUS
BUT LIFE IS ONE LONG BATTLE AND I’LL BE VICTORIOUS
THE PRIZE AT THE END IS FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW MY NAME
AND IF THIS IS CHAPTER ONE
MAYBE THE REAL STORY’S ALMOST BEGUN
WILL FATE FINALLY LET ME SHOW WHAT I WOULD DO FOR FAME?
IT’S WHO I AM, I’VE GOT INSATIABLE AMBITION THAT CAN’T BE TAMED


(Some more villagers enter. This time, he doesn’t succeed in scaring them. They laugh at him.) 


VILLAGERS
LOOKS LIKE CULANN THE SMITH HAS A NEW GUARD DOG


SETANTA 
YEAH, I OWED HIM A FAVOR, NOW MOVE ALONG


VILLAGERS
OR ELSE? 


SETANTA
I’LL DO MY JOB AND CHASE YOU OFF
I KNOW YOU KNOW I’M MONSTROUSLY STRONG


VILLAGERS
WE’LL GO, OKAY, BUT DON’T LOOK SO SULLEN
BE A NICE DOGGY, CU CHULAINN! 


        (They exit, still laughing.) 


SETANTA
BETTER THAN BEING THE TYPE THAT’S A DIME A DOZEN
IF IT MAKES YOU REMEMBER ME, FINE, CALL ME CU CHULAINN


(A teenage girl, EMER, enters. Unlike the plainly dressed villagers, she’s wearing an expensive looking dress and a circlet.) 


EMER 
Hi, Setanta? 


SETANTA
Oh! Emer! You made it. 


EMER
This is where you wanted to meet? Not the fanciest date I’ve been on...


SETANTA
No no, we’ll go on the date when my shift’s over. I’m at work. This is Culann the Smith’s house. 


EMER
Is that why those people called you Cu Chulainn? Hound of Culann? 


SETANTA
Ugh, you heard that? 


EMER
It sounds like there’s a story behind that nickname. Come on, let’s get to know each other. What happened? 


SETANTA
CULANN THE SMITH USED TO HAVE A REAL GUARD DOG
AT LEAST UNTIL I CAME ALONG
IT CHASED ME DOWN AND WHEN I’M PISSED OFF
I GO OUT OF CONTROL AND GET MONSTROUSLY STRONG
I BLACKED OUT THEN THERE’S A DEAD DOG ALL OF A SUDDEN
I OWED CULANN A REPLACEMENT, SO NOW I’M CU CHULAINN




EMER 
I’M NOT SURE I SHOULD COURT A BOY WHO KILLS DOGS


SETANTA 
IT WASN’T ON PURPOSE! I’M JUST A TEEN DEMIGOD
MY FATHER’S HALF FOMORIAN AND HALF TUATHA DE DANANN
AND I HEARD THAT DEMON BLOOD IS SOMETHING WE HAVE IN COMMON


EMER 
YOU’RE RIGHT, WE BOTH NEVER CHOSE TO BE THIS WAY


SETANTA 
THOUGH HONESTLY, IF I COULD CHANGE IT, I THINK I’D LET IT STAY


I LONG FOR A LIFE THAT’S THRILLING AND GLORIOUS
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS AS LONG AS I’M VICTORIOUS
I’LL GLADLY LET MY WILD SIDE TAKE THE REIGNS
I’VE HEARD THAT JUST BEFORE YOU DIE
IS WHEN YOU FEEL THE MOST ALIVE
SO I’LL RISK IT ALL TO FEEL THE BLOOD RUSH THROUGH MY VEINS
THAT’S WHO I AM SO DON’T STICK AROUND IF YOU EXPECT ME TO CHANGE


So? Still want to go on a date? If it makes you feel better, I’m much, much less likely to attack you than I am to attack someone who’s mean to you. I’ll be your guard dog too! 


(EMER laughs, then sighs.) 


EMER
I can’t lie, I do have a thing for bad boys. 


SETANTA
That’s a yes? 


EMER
Sure. Where’s the real date? 


SETANTA
The king’s fortress. Come on, let’s go! 


EMER
Your shift’s over already? 


SETANTA
Who cares? Do you know how exciting it is for a girl to not be scared away? 


EMER
Okay! 


(They dance and a crowd of VILLAGERS enters as the scene shifts to the royal site of their kingdom. One villager is carrying a basket of apples. CATHBAD, a cloaked druid, also enters.) 


SETANTA
It’s way more crowded than I thought it’d be. What gives?


EMER
Look, it’s the chief druid!


HE MUST BE GIVING OUT


EMER & VILLAGERS
PROPHECIES
WE CAN BE A PART OF PROPHECIES
THEY CAN BE YOUR DOOM OR EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED
DETERMINE IF YOU FAIL OR IF YOU SUCCEED


EMER 
SOMETHING LIKE
IF A COUPLE KISSES AT SUNSET TONIGHT, THEY’RE DESTINED FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE


CATHBAD
KEEP IN MIND
IF YOU’RE LOCKED INTO A PROPHECY, THERE’S NO WAY TO UNDO THE DAMAGE


SETANTA
That may be a risk I’m willing to take. 


I’LL ADMIT I WISH I HAD A BETTER REPUTATION
THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF I COME UP IN CONVERSATION


VILLAGERS
OH LOOK, IT’S THAT CU CHULAINN! 


SETANTA
I DON’T WANT TO DIE WHILE PEOPLE THINK OF ME HOW THEY DO NOW
THERE’S GOT TO BE A WAY TO CHANGE IT, IT’S JUST A MATTER OF HOW
GO ON, TELL ME HOW


VILLAGERS
COME ON, WHAT WILL IT BE? 
GO ON, GIVE US THE PROPHECIES! 


CATHBAD
The stars have given me 5 prophecies for today. 


ANYONE WHO EATS AN APPLE TODAY WILL EVENTUALLY DIE BY CHOKING ON ONE


VILLAGER WITH APPLES
Aagh! 


(The villager drops his basket of apples.) 




CATHBAD
ANYONE WHO’S DREADING A SOCIAL EVENT TODAY WILL END UP HAVING A LOT OF FUN


ANXIOUS VILLAGER
Oh, thank goodness. 


CATHBAD
ANYONE WHO GETS MARRIED TODAY WILL HAVE ONLY DAUGHTERS AND NO SONS
ANYONE WHO BUILDS SOMETHING TODAY WILL WATCH IT FALL APART AS SOON AS IT’S DONE


VILLAGERS
THAT MAKES FOUR, THAT MEANS THERE’S JUST ONE LEFT
SO WHAT WILL IT BE? 


CATHBAD
ANYONE WHO TAKES UP ARMS TODAY WILL HAVE A SHORT LIFE BUT GLORIOUS DEATH


SETANTA
NOW THAT SURE SOUNDS LIKE ME! 
EMER, SHOULD I DO IT? 


EMER
ABSOLUTELY, YOU SHOULD GO
DON’T WORRY ABOUT ME, I CAN’T BE SAD OVER WHAT I ALREADY KNOW
IT WAS ALWAYS IN MY FUTURE THAT ONE DAY I’LL BE A WIDOW
MIGHT AS WELL BE THE WIDOW OF A LEGENDARY HERO


SETANTA
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT, A LEGENDARY HERO


VILLAGERS
LEGENDARY HERO


(A villager brings SETANTA a sword.) 


SETANTA
I DON’T WANT TO BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT’S A DIME A DOZEN
I’LL GLADLY TAKE A DEATH THAT’S LEGENDARY BUT SUDDEN
YOU WON’T SEE ME CRYING, POUTING AND SULLEN
BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL KNOW MY NAME- SETANTA


SETANTA & VILLAGERS
CU CHULAINN!


SETANTA & VILLAGERS & EMER & CATHBAD


SO GIVE ME A LIFE THAT’S SHORT AND GLORIOUS
I DON’T CARE WHEN I DIE AS LONG AS I’M VICTORIOUS
I’LL GLADLY LET MY WILD SIDE TAKE THE REIGNS
I’VE HEARD THAT JUST BEFORE YOU DIE
IS WHEN YOU FEEL THE MOST ALIVE
SO I’LL RISK IT ALL TO FEEL THE BLOOD RUSH THROUGH MY VEINS


SETANTA
AND THEN I’LL BE A LEGEND ONE DAY


VILLAGERS & EMER & CATHBAD
EVERYONE WILL KNOW YOUR NAME


SETANTA & VILLAGERS & EMER & CATHBAD
CU CHULAINN!

Scene 2


(A quaint village. SETANTA and EMER enter, hand in hand, giggling and gazing at each other.) 


SETANTA 
I think my friends are getting tired of hearing about you. 


EMER
Aw, you talk about me that much? 


SETANTA
Yeah, of course. Plus they’ve always bugged me about just settling down already. I think the longer I court you, the more mad they get that I haven’t married you yet. 


EMER
Why do they care? Are they afraid if you’re single you’ll steal their girlfriends or something? 


SETANTA
Yes, actually. Good guess. 


EMER
No way! 


(Three men enter. They notice EMER and leer at her.) 


CREEP 1
Hey, beautiful. Want to come with us? 


EMER
Ew, no. 


(SETANTA glares at the creepy men and puts his arm around EMER protectively.) 




CREEP 2
Really? This beardless boy is the best you can do? Wouldn’t you rather have a real man? 


(SETANTA’s breathing becomes labored as his fury slowly builds near to the point of bursting.)


SETANTA
Leave her alone. She’s not interested. 


CREEP 3
And what are you going to actually do about it? Neither of you can make us leave. Just give us what we want. 


EMER
Oh, it’s going to be fun seeing how much you regret this in a few minutes. 


(The men laugh.) 


CREEP 1
Yeah, no, this little boy isn’t going to protect you, bitch. He’s outnumbered. 


CREEP 2
And outmatched. 


(Unable and unwilling to contain his rage any further, SETANTA turns monstrous. Growling and out of control, he leaps onto one of the men and shoves him to the ground so hard that he ceases to move or speak. The other two men freak out and try to run away, but SETANTA grabs the arm of one of them and throws him to the ground. The man screams. A small crowd enters, curious about the commotion, then watches horrified. SETANTA chases the two men around as EMER watches adoringly.) 




VILLAGER
Lady Emer? What are you doing so close to that monster? We need to get to safety!  


EMER
Oh. I guess I shouldn’t let this go on for too long. 


(SETANTA finally grabs one of the men and stops to hit him into the ground. He keeps hitting him. The other man runs away. EMER calmly approaches SETANTA.) 


VILLAGER
Don’t go toward him! Are you crazy? 


EMER
Maybe. 


#2 DEEP DOWN
	

(She touches SETANTA’s shoulder, getting his attention. He stops hitting the man and stands.) 


EMER
I’M HERE, MY DARLING, AND I WILL STAY
FOR AS LONG AS YOU NEED ME TO SHOW YOU THE WAY
I KNOW YOU CAN SEE ME SO I’LL LOOK RIGHT THROUGH 
THE MONSTER AND SEE YOU, JUST YOU


IF YOU SEARCH DEEP DOWN, THERE’S A GENTLE PART OF YOU
THAT NEVER BREAKS
IF YOU TAKE MY HAND, I’LL PROVE THAT IT’S TRUE
NO MATTER YOUR MISTAKES


(He takes her hand.) 


WHEN I SEARCH DEEP DOWN, I FIND NO FEAR
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I KNOW YOU
EVERY TIME I’VE TRUSTED YOU I’VE FOUND
I WAS RIGHT TO LOVE WHO YOU ARE DEEP DOWN


(He breathes deeply, his posture straightens. He’s snapped out of it.) 


SETANTA
Wow. You actually- How? Why? 


EMER
THERE MIGHT BE A MONSTER DEEP DOWN IN ME TOO
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOVE IT BECAUSE I LOVE YOU


(They embrace. While he’s distracted, the villagers shake the men awake and help them run away.) 


SETANTA
I don’t know if you understand how amazing that was. Usually when I turn into a monster my rampage doesn’t stop until I pass out from using so much energy. I’ve never just calmed down enough to snap out of it before. No one’s tried to make that happen before. Everyone just hides. And I can’t blame them. I didn’t expect you to do that. 


EMER
Why wouldn’t I trust my very own guard dog? 


SETANTA
I’m serious, Emer. I think you’re my soulmate. I want to marry you. 


EMER
Oh, Setanta, I would love to... It’s just...


SETANTA
Your dad? 




EMER
He’s always been overprotective. And stubborn. I don’t know if I can get him to see you as more than a monster. 


SETANTA
Okay, and? That’s not going to stop me. I’ll never find another girl like you. I’ve been searching for you my whole life. And now I’m already starting to make plans in my head for our future. 


EMER
I want to picture it too... Okay, fine. Let’s ask for his blessing! 
________________
Scene 3


(A fortress where a chieftain resides. There are guards inside, including LUGAID. EMER enters with SETANTA following behind her.) 


EMER
Dad? Hey, can you get my dad to come down, please? 


LUGAID
Lord Forgall! Your eldest daughter has brought home a boy again! 


(FORGALL, EMER’s grumpy father, enters begrudgingly.) 


FORGALL
Great, another one. 


SETANTA
Sir, I’ve come here to ask for your blessing to- 


FORGALL
No. 


EMER
You haven’t even given him a chance yet! 


FORGALL
I know who he is. It’s that son of Lugh who lets his nonhuman side overpower him and goes on rampages. Not my top choice for a son-in-law. 


SETANTA
It doesn’t even impress you that my dad is a literal deity? 








FORGALL
Only when you phrase it like that. But he isn’t just a member of the fair folk. His mother, your grandmother, was a princess of monsters. 


EMER
But we have that heritage too! 


FORGALL
Exactly, family gatherings are messy enough with the Fomorii we’re already related to. We don’t need more marrying in. And I also don’t want my grandchildren having any more monster blood in them than as little as possible. Especially if they take after him. 


(SETANTA’s breathing gets heavy. EMER holds his hand and he relaxes.) 


EMER
Dad, just give him a chance! He’s not as dangerous as you think. Especially not when he’s with me. 


FORGALL
Guards, remove this boy from my fortress. 


(The guards seize SETANTA, but they struggle to move him from where he stands.) 


SETANTA
Have you ever approved of your daughter’s choice in lovers? If it’s not me, who will be enough for you? You have to let her live her life. 


(FORGALL lets out a deep sigh.) 


#4 PROVE YOURSELF
	



FORGALL
The job of a father of a teenage girl is so underappreciated. 


I DO MY VERY BEST, I DO WHATEVER IT WILL TAKE
TO PROTECT MY DAUGHTER FROM ALL HARM
I’LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY SHE SETS HERSELF UP FOR HEARTACHE
HOW SHE LOOKS DISASTER IN THE EYE AND RUNS INTO ITS ARMS
I CAN'T STOP HER FROM GOING WHERE SHE WANTS TO GO
BUT WHEN YOU ASK FOR MY BLESSING OF COURSE I SAY NO 


EMER
Dad, we’ve been over this! Why can’t you just trust me? 


FORGALL
You know why. 


EMER
Setanta, you talk to him. He’s never listened to me, of course he’s not going to start now. 


SETANTA
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, I HAVE TO DISAGREE
I WOULD NEVER DO YOUR DAUGHTER ANY HARM
THE BEST HUSBAND FOR YOUR DAUGHTER IS VERY CLEARLY ME
I’LL USE MY STRENGTH TO PROTECT HER AND YOU CAN’T DENY MY CHARM


FORGALL
Yes I can. 


SETANTA
Why? 


FORGALL
EVEN IF SHE’S FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING I'VE TAUGHT HER
THERE'S STILL ONE THING I CAN DO FOR MY DAUGHTER
SHUT YOU DOWN


(FORGALL points, cueing his guards to try removing SETANTA again. They fail again.) 


FORGALL
UNLESS SOMEHOW
YOU PROVE YOURSELF 


SETANTA
I’ll do it! I’ll face any challenge! What do you need from me? 


FORGALL
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT, I KNOW IT MAY NOT BE WISE
IF YOU’RE TOO STUBBORN TO LEAVE, MAYBE THERE’S A COMPROMISE


SETANTA
Just tell me what it is! 


FORGALL
I KNOW OF SOMEONE WHO CAN TRAIN YOU TO BEHAVE
AT THE FORTRESS OF SHADOWS IN SKYE
SHE’LL TEACH YOU TO BE MORE WISE THAN YOU ARE BRAVE
TO THINK BEFORE SOMEBODY DIES
SO IF YOU WANT A CHANCE OF MARRYING MY DAUGHTER
SET SAIL TO THAT ISLAND TONIGHT
ELSE I’LL LIVE IN TERROR OF YOUR SUDDEN SLAUGHTERS
DO WE HAVE A DEAL? 


SETANTA
ALRIGHT! 


(The guards release their grasp on SETANTA.) 


SETANTA
IT WON’T TAKE LONG
FOR ME TO PROVE YOU WRONG
I WILL PROVE MYSELF
YOU WON’T BE DISAPPOINTED, JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE
THIS TRAINING OVER IN SKYE WILL BRING OUT THE BEST IN ME


FORGALL & GUARDS 
GO ON AND PROVE YOURSELF


SETANTA
I WON’T WASTE A MOMENT I COULD SPEND EARNING YOUR TRUST
I’LL GO AND FIND A BOAT RIGHT NOW TO LEAVE IRELAND IF I MUST


FORGALL & GUARDS
GO ON AND PROVE YOURSELF


SETANTA
I PROMISE I’LL BE BACK BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW I’M GONE
I’LL ACE THIS TRAINING AND RETURN WITH BRAINS AND NOT JUST BRAWN


FORGALL & GUARDS
GO ON AND PROVE YOURSELF


SETANTA
SOON WE’LL ALL FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT I’M WORTHY OF
I’LL BE THE KIND OF HERO WHO’D DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE


SETANTA & GUARDS & EMER
AND PROVE MYSELF
I WILL PROVE MYSELF
I WILL PROVE MYSELF


FORGALL
Okay, great. Now get going. 


EMER
You’re really leaving? 


SETANTA
If it means we can have a future together, we can bear a little time apart. 


(EMER, on the verge of tears, hugs SETANTA.) 


EMER
I’m going to miss you. But wait, what about your job? You can’t just abandon that. 


FORGALL
I’ll get Culann a new guard dog. This is your new responsibility. 


SETANTA
Sounds like an upgrade to me. Emer, you will see me again very soon. That’s a promise. We’ll stay in touch through letters in the meantime. Trust me, it’ll be worth it in the end. 


EMER
Okay... 


(She finally lets him go. He gives her a kiss, then exits.) 


EMER
Dad, thank you for giving him a chance. 


(FORGALL laughs.) 


FORGALL
You’re not marrying that boy. 


EMER
What? What about when he comes back after doing everything you asked of him? 


FORGALL
He won’t. I sent him to train with Scathach, daughter of the goddess of war, at her fortress of shadows. The training there is infamously dangerous. Many young warriors never come back from it alive. 


EMER
That’s a new low for you! 


FORGALL
This boy is a new low for you. 


EMER
Whatever! He’ll prove you wrong and come back stronger and wiser than ever, and I’m going to marry him! 


FORGALL
Or, you’ll forget about him like you forgot about all the others. And maybe I’ll be lucky and you’ll finally pick sensibly for once. You have to grow up eventually. 


EMER
Fate will prove one of us wrong, and it won’t be me. It hasn’t so far. 
________________
Scene 4


(Training grounds outside of a dark castle. Young soldiers in training are sparring with each other as a stern, muscular woman, SCATHACH, oversees. SETANTA enters, half eager and half shy. Some notice him and pause to look.) 


SETANTA
Uh, hi. That looks fun, mind if I join? 


SCATHACH
Are you my new pupil? 


SETANTA
Yes! My name is Setanta. But I’m better known as Cu Chulainn. I’m kind of a local celebrity where I come from. I don’t know if anyone here has heard of me. 


SCATHACH
No. 


(The other pupils either shrug or shake their heads.) 


SETANTA
Hopefully that’ll change one day. It’s my destiny to be a war hero. My death will be legendary! 


#4A CU CHULAINN (REPRISE)
	

I’LL HAVE A LIFE THAT’S SHORT AND GLORIOUS
I DON’T CARE WHEN I DIE AS LONG AS I’M VICTORIOUS
I’LL GLADLY LET MY WILD SIDE TAKE THE REIGNS
I’VE HEARD THAT JUST BEFORE YOU DIE
IS WHEN YOU FEEL THE MOST ALIVE
SO I’LL RISK IT ALL TO FEEL THE BLOOD RUSH THROUGH MY VEINS
AND THEN I’LL BE A LEGEND ONE DAY


SCATHACH
You sound like a useless soldier. 


SETANTA
Huh? 


SCATHACH
How much of an actual contribution to a war effort are you going to make if the whole time you’re only thinking of dying in a way that would make you look as cool and memorable as possible? 


SETANTA
But that’s the thing, it’d only be cool if I do make a big contribution, like winning the battle after all seems lost with an epic sacrifice! 


SCATHACH
And then after that you’ll never be useful again because you’ll be dead. 


SETANTA
Well, yeah, but- 


SCATHACH
How much actual fighting experience do you have? 


SETANTA
I’m the best hurling player in all of Ireland. 


SCATHACH
That’s not what I asked. 


SETANTA
Okay, well, I took up arms several months ago because a prophecy told me to. But mostly when I have to fight, I let my magical side do the work. And it does the job really well, often too well, and I can’t control it. Which hasn’t earned me the best reputation. That’s why I’m here. 


SCATHACH
I suppose that would explain why you’re so short-sighted. You came to me so I can teach you, right? 


SETANTA
Yeah! 


#5 WARRIOR’S BOND
	

SCATHACH
Then pay attention. This will be your first lesson. 


WAR DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND YOU
OF COURSE YOU’LL DIE YOUNG WITH SUCH A NARROW VIEW
DON’T IGNORE ALL YOUR LOYAL ALLIES
IF YOU WANT TO BE RELIED ON


SCATHACH & PUPILS 
YOU MUST LEARN TO RELY ON THEM TOO


SCATHACH
GOOD LUCK GETTING ANYTHING DONE


SCATHACH & PUPILS
IF YOU WANT TO BE THE ONLY REASON A BATTLE IS WON


SCATHACH
TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS BIGGER THAN YOURSELF


SCATHACH & PUPILS
YOU NEED A TEAM
AND A TRULY TIGHT KNIT TEAM IS SECOND TO NONE


NOTHING COMPARES TO A WARRIOR’S BOND
BATTLE AND BLOODSHED ONLY STRENGTHEN YOUR FONDNESS
FOR THE PEOPLE YOU AREN’T KILLING
THERE’S NOTHING QUITE AS THRILLING
ALL YOU NEED IS A WARRIOR’S BOND
TO REACH YOUR POTENTIAL AND THEN RISE BEYOND IT
THERE’S NOTHING AS FULFILLING
YOU CAN HAVE IT AS LONG AS YOU’RE WILLING 


FORGET THE PEOPLE YOU LEFT AT HOME
TRUE BONDS ARE BORN BY BREAKING BONES
THIS BLOOD IS THICKER THAN THE WATER OF THE WOMB
FOR IF YOU LOVE YOUR BATTLE BRETHREN
YOU WON’T THINK ABOUT SURRENDERING
THEY FUEL YOUR WILL TO FIGHT TO SURVIVE EVEN CERTAIN DOOM
THAT’S WHAT A WARRIOR’S BOND WILL DO


SCATHACH 
Alright everyone, it’s time to switch sparring partners! Would anyone like to volunteer to spar with the new kid? 


(One of the pupils, FERDIAD, looks around panicking slightly as everyone around him partners up. He turns towards SCATHACH and SETANTA.) 


FERDIAD
I’ll do it! 


SETANTA
Hey, thanks. You are? 


FERDIAD
Name’s Ferdiad. Ready? Don’t be scared, I’m far from the strongest here. 


SETANTA
Ready. 


(They begin sparring-dancing.) 


FERDIAD
YOU KNOW, I KIND OF ADMIRE YOU FOR HOW
YOU WANT TO FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLES STARTING RIGHT NOW
THE REAL YOU IS WEAK BUT THAT CAN BE CHANGED, I WOULD KNOW


FERDIAD & SETANTA 
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AS WE TURN OUR LIVES AROUND


ALL
NOTHING COMPARES TO A WARRIOR’S BOND
BATTLE AND BLOODSHED ONLY STRENGTHEN YOUR FONDNESS
FOR THE PEOPLE YOU AREN’T KILLING
THERE’S NOTHING QUITE AS THRILLING
ALL YOU NEED IS A WARRIOR’S BOND
TO REACH YOUR POTENTIAL AND THEN RISE BEYOND IT
THERE’S NOTHING AS FULFILLING
YOU CAN HAVE IT AS LONG AS YOU’RE WILLING 


FERDIAD
FORGET THE PEOPLE YOU LEFT AT HOME


ALL
TRUE BONDS ARE BORN BY BREAKING BONES


FERDIAD
THIS BLOOD IS THICKER THAN THE WATER OF THE WOMB
FOR IF YOU LOVE YOUR BATTLE BRETHREN


ALL
YOU WON’T THINK ABOUT SURRENDERING
THEY FUEL YOUR WILL TO FIGHT TO SURVIVE EVEN CERTAIN DOOM
THAT’S WHAT A WARRIOR’S BOND WILL DO
THAT’S WHAT A WARRIOR’S BOND WILL DO


FERDIAD & SETANTA
THAT’S WHAT A WARRIOR’S BOND WILL


ALL
THAT’S WHAT A WARRIOR’S BOND WILL DO


SCATHACH
Good job everyone! Take a short break for now. 


(The pupils stop sparring and disperse. Some exit, leaving a small group including SETANTA and FERDIAD. They sit down to relax. SCATHACH exits.)


FERDIAD
Not bad for a newbie. I see a lot of potential in you. 


SETANTA
Thanks, dude. At least someone does. It didn’t seem like Scathach was all that impressed. 


FERDIAD
Nah, she’s a tough love kind of gal. She has a keen eye for this kind of thing. I bet she noticed, but she won’t say anything about it until she thinks it won’t get to your head. 


SETANTA
And you’re not worried about that? 


FERDIAD
It’s not my problem. 


(The other pupils reconfigure themselves into a vaguely round formation.)


FERDIAD
Oh, it looks like the story circle is about to start. Let’s join in. 


(FERDIAD approaches the circle.)  


FERDIAD
Hey, do you mind if me and the new kid lead this one? 


(The pupils in the middle make room for FERDIAD and SETANTA to sit.) 


SETANTA
So this is what you guys do during your breaks? 


FERDIAD
Yeah. Students of Scathach come from all over, so everyone is bound to have a story no one else here has heard before. Especially you since you’re brand new. 


#6 TELL THE STORY
	

WHEN HEROES AND VILLAINS ARE BORN AND LEGENDS START TO FORM
IT GIVES US AVERAGE FOLK SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE’RE BORED
WE’RE ENTERTAINED BY THE HEROIC, TRAGIC, FUNNY, AND GOREY
THAT’S WHY WHEN IT REACHES US WE PASS ALONG THE STORY
GO ON, TELL THE STORY
THAT’S CLOSEST TO YOUR HEART
WE ALL TELL STORIES
IT’S TIME FOR YOU TO DO YOUR PART


SETANTA
Oh boy, I don’t know which one to pick.  


FERDIAD
Like, got any noteworthy friends or family? 


SETANTA
Do I? Where do you think my overpowered magic side comes from? My father is Lugh- a god, and a revered hero among the gods at that. Here’s what he told me when I was a child. 


(SETANTA stands to pantomime the story as he tells it.) 


SETANTA
Long ago, before the Gaels came to Ireland, the monstrous Fomorii and mystical Tuatha De Danann were at war. My dad was the grandson of Balor of the Evil Eye, the monsters’ leader, but he chose to be a champion of his enemies instead. But his own side locked him up because they thought he was too important to die. So he escaped and won the battle by knocking Balor’s eye out with a slingshot. And as it rolled away, it killed Balor’s own army! 


(The pupils laugh and clap.) 


SETANTA
So yeah, that’s my favorite story. Ever since I heard it, I’ve wanted to be a hero just as brave and beloved as him. 


FERDIAD
That’s a good one. You’re even cooler than I thought, Setanta. I’m sparring partners with a demigod! I’ve touched a demigod. 


(FERDIAD pokes SETANTA.) 


FERDIAD
I just did it again. 


SETANTA
What about you? What stories did you tell before I got here? 








FERDIAD
Well, I don’t have any impressive heritage like that, that I know of. But I do happen to personally know Queen Medb of Connacht. 


(FERDIAD stands to pantomime the story.) 


FERDIAD
Here’s what she told me about how she came to rule our kingdom. At first she was just a princess, the daughter of the high king of Ireland. She was forced to marry King Conchobar of Ulster, who mistreated her until she could no longer bear it. She fled to Connacht, deposed the king and made him her lover, and married her bodyguard. And now she’s a queen, equal with her king in every way, even wealth and livestock. 


(More clapping and oohing from the pupils.) 


FERDIAD
I just think it’s nice to see that victims can rise up like that. Even if you’re underestimated, you’re capable of so much more than people expect. 


SETANTA
Wait, wait. The ruler of your kingdom and the ruler of my kingdom are bitter exes. 


FERDIAD
Ha, yeah. And look at us. That’s the strength of a warrior’s bond. 


SETANTA
What if our kingdoms go to war one day? 


FERDIAD
Maybe we could still find a way to fight side by side. We’ll cross that bridge if we get to it. Stop worrying so much. 


SETANTA
I have a destiny, you know. And I want you to be part of it. 


(SCATHACH enters.) 


SCATHACH
Break time is over now. Get back to fighting. 


(Everyone stands.) 


SETANTA
Loser of the next spar has to defect?


FERDIAD
Sure. 


(All the pupils start sparring again.) 


#6A TELL THE STORY (REPRISE) 
	

SETANTA & FERDIAD
ONE DAY THEY’LL TELL THE STORY OF US FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE
WE WILL BOTH BE LEGENDS LONG AFTER WE’VE DIED
FOR NOW WE TELL THE STORY OF HEROES WE WISH WE WERE LIKE
WE GET CLOSER EVERY DAY, WE TRAIN AND BIDE OUR TIME


(SETANTA wins, knocking FERDIAD down.) 


FERDIAD
Well, I tried. 


(SETANTA helps FERDIAD up.) 
________________


Scene 5


(Inside the fortress of shadows. SETANTA enters holding a scroll. As he opens it, EMER enters on the other side.) 


EMER
My dearest Setanta, I want to hear all about your new life over in Skye, so I can imagine myself there with you and hopefully miss you a little less. Sorry if I sound clingy. I didn’t expect to get this attached. I just can’t stop thinking about all the romantic things you said, like how you can’t live without me, how you’d do anything to fight for a love as rare as ours, and... I hope they’re still true by the time you complete your training. Please be safe and return to me as soon as you can. Until then, I hope you’re having fun. Sending my love from far away, Emer. 


(EMER blows a kiss then exits.) 


SETANTA
That’s so sweet. I’m so lucky to have her. I need to write a reply to my one true love across the sea. 


(FERDIAD enters.) 


FERDIAD
Hey, there you are. What have you been up to all night? 


SETANTA
I’m just about to go send this letter to my girlfriend. 
 
FERDIAD
Oh. Your girlfriend. I see. 


SETANTA
What about it? 




FERDIAD
You have a girlfriend while you’re off training across the sea from her? 


SETANTA
Yes I do. I’m going to marry her when I get back. I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. My friends tried to set me up with some girls but she’s the only one I wanted. 


FERDIAD
So... You have a girlfriend while you’re off training across the sea from her and you’re loyal to her? 


SETANTA
Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?
 
FERDIAD
I don’t know why but you just give me the vibe that in some alternate reality you really get around. 


SETANTA
And you’re sad you’re not in that reality.


#8 UNFETTERED
	

FERDIAD
Well listen, I’m just concerned on your behalf that you might be missing out. 


SETANTA
Missing out on what exactly?


FERDIAD
THERE’S A WHOLE LOT OF DANGER IN THE LIFE WE’RE LIVING
SO WHY NOT HAVE FUN WITH THE TIME YOU’RE GIVEN
LIFE IS WAY TOO SHORT TO TIE YOURSELF DOWN
THERE’S SO MUCH TO SEE IF YOU’D ONLY LOOK AROUND
DON’T KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED
OR ELSE YOU’LL NEVER KNOW


SETANTA
Know what? 


FERDIAD
WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE UNFETTERED
A FEARLESS, LIBERATED GO GETTER
NOT STUCK AT HOME WRITING LETTERS
LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER 
WHEN YOU’RE UNFETTERED


THERE’S A BIT OF DANGER IN WASTING POTENTIAL
YOU’LL LOOK BACK AND WISH YOU WERE MORE EXPERIMENTAL
YOU’RE NEGLECTING TO NURTURE A VERSION OF YOU
THAT HAS WAY MORE FUN FOR THE SAKE OF STAYING TRUE
YOU’RE KEEPING YOUR EYES CLOSED
YOU’LL REGRET THAT YOU’LL NEVER KNOW


SETANTA 
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE UNFETTERED? 


FERDIAD & SETANTA
A FEARLESS, LIBERATED GO GETTER
NOT STUCK AT HOME WRITING LETTERS


FERDIAD
LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER 
WHEN YOU’RE UNFETTERED
SETANTA
I’D BE LYING IF I SAID I’M NOT CONSIDERING IT AT ALL


FERDIAD
THAT’S YOUR HEART TALKING, SO YOU BETTER HEED THE CALL


SETANTA
I KNOW HER PRETTY WELL BY NOW
SHE MAY ACTUALLY BE FINE WITH IT
BUT WHAT WILL HER FATHER THINK
HE’LL THINK I’M TOO RECKLESS TO COMMIT


FERDIAD
YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AREN’T UP TO HIM
NEVER LET NAYSAYERS DECIDE YOUR PATH


SETANTA 
BUT IT WAS ALREADY LOOKING WAY TOO GRIM


FERDIAD
BUT YOU’LL NEVER KNOW UNLESS YOU ASK
JUST SEND HER THE LETTER
YOU’LL BE UNFETTERED
YOU’LL SEE THAT LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER
SO TELL ME, DON’T YOU WANT TO BE UNFETTERED? 


SETANTA
I don’t know. Even if she is okay with it in principle, she’ll probably just say what I’m thinking- Our top priority is getting her father’s blessing for us to marry. We can’t do anything that’ll risk that. And knowing him, I bet he finds a way to read all of our letters. He can’t even know that I was thinking of this. 


FERDIAD
Suit yourself. I hope she’s worth it. 


SETANTA
She is. 
________________
Scene 6


(The training grounds outside of the Fortress of Shadows. Pairs of pupils, including SETANTA and FERDIAD, are sparring as SCATHACH makes her way around monitoring them.) 


SETANTA
How am I doing? Am I getting better? 


SCATHACH
Yes, I see improvement. I also sense a bit of tension between you two. 


(Flustered, SETANTA and FERDIAD stop sparring.) 


SETANTA
What? No. We’re best buds. Right bro? 


FERDIAD
The bestest ever. 


SCATHACH
It’s fine, actually. I need you two to stop sparring with each other for a bit. 


FERDIAD
Oh? Why?


SCATHACH
So I can spar with Cu Chulainn. 


SETANTA
Does this mean what I think it means? 


SCATHACH
It’s time to put you to the test. 


(SCATHACH takes a potion from her belt.) 


SCATHACH
While we fight, I’m going to purposefully provoke you into transforming so we can measure how long you can resist it. When it happens, Ferdiad will help me force this relaxation potion down your throat. 


FERDIAD
Okay! 


(SCATHACH hands the potion to FERDIAD.) 


SCATHACH
It’s potent enough to make a regular human fall asleep, so it should be enough to make your monstrous alter ego recede. 


SETANTA
And you’re sure I won’t badly injure you while I’m out of control? 


SCATHACH
Don’t make a habit of insulting your teacher like that. I am a daughter of the Morrigan. Of all the warriors of the isles, my strength is only matched by my own twin. 


SETANTA
Sorry. 


SCATHACH
Of course, I reserve the right to insult you. I have to in order for this experiment to work. 


SETANTA
Alright. Do your worst! I’m ready to prove myself! 


#9 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
	

(FERDIAD steps back to give them space. SETANTA and SCATHACH begin to spar.) 


SCATHACH
LET ME SEE IF I CAN HIT YOU WHERE IT HURTS
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD SO FIRST THING'S FIRST
YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW YOUR WORTH
YOU'RE WAY OVERSHOOTING, GET BACK DOWN TO EARTH
EVERYONE CAN SEE YOU'RE NOT THAT SPECIAL
DIME A DOZEN SOLDIER PRETENDING HE'S ESSENTIAL 


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE


SCATHACH
THAT YOU CAN SPEEDRUN GOING FROM ZERO TO HERO


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH 


SCATHACH
YOU'RE NOT SOME SHINING STAR
WE KNOW THAT’S NOT WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE


SCATHACH
AND I HEARD YOU'VE GOT A GIRL BACK HOME
YOU MUST TRUST HER A LOT TO HAVE LEFT HER ALL ALONE
DO YOU REALLY THINK SHE LIKES TO WAIT
SHE'S GONNA HAVE A LOT OF SUITORS IF SHE'S REALLY THAT GREAT


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE




SCATHACH
THAT SHE'D GIVE UP HER YOUTH WHILE YOU'RE OFF HAVING FUN


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH 


SCATHACH 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN SHE'S THAT FAR
IF SHE ALREADY DECIDED YOU AND HER ARE DONE


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE


SCATHACH
AND I HEARD YOU HAVE SOME GODLY BLOOD
FROM YOUR DAD WHO MUST BE THINKING THIS SON IS A DUD
YOU COULD LIVE FOREVER AND CHILL OUT BUT INSTEAD
YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL AND OF COURSE YOU'D RATHER BE DEAD


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE


SCATHACH
SIGNING RIGHT UP FOR SUCH A FOOLISH FATE 


(SCATHACH gains the clear advantage in the fight, with SETANTA on the ground struggling.) 


SCATHACH
BUT I BET WHEN YOU GET YOUR FIRST BATTLE SCAR
YOU’LL SUDDENLY WANT TO PUSH BACK YOUR DEATH DATE


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OH DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? 


SCATHACH
ARE YOU SURE YOUR REWARD WILL BE WORTH THE PAIN? 
DOES YOUR EGO REALLY TELL YOU YOUR STORY’S HERE TO STAY? 
YOU SEEM TO UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH WILL FADE AWAY


SCATHACH & PUPILS
OUR KINGDOMS, OUR CULTURE, THE LANGUAGE WE SPEAK
YOU THINK THEY’LL BE OUTLASTED BY SOMEONE SO WEAK? 
YOU’LL BE JUST ANOTHER BODY ON THE BATTLEFIELD FORGOTTEN
EVERY TRACE OF YOU LOST NOT LONG AFTER IT WENT ROTTEN


(SETANTA finally loses his cool. He breaks free and leaps at SCATHACH, growling, but she dodges and he falls down from the momentum.) 


SCATHACH
WOAH
There we go! Ferdiad, quick, the potion! 


(SCATHACH pins down the rabid SETANTA. FERDIAD hands her the potion then helps to hold SETANTA down as he struggles. SCATHACH pours the potion into SETANTA’s mouth. They let him sit up so he can swallow.) 


SETANTA
Oh. Shit. Guess that means I failed, huh? 


SCATHACH
Yes, but that was to be expected. 


SETANTA
Thanks. 


SCATHACH
I am impressed how long you kept control of yourself. It took me 3 verses, 3 choruses, and a bridge to finally make you snap. 


FERDIAD
Yeah, good job! 


SCATHACH
You’ll get there. You just have to keep practicing. But that idea shouldn’t be anything new to you by now. 


SETANTA
Right. Okay, I’m ready to try again! 


SCATHACH
Not now! Get some rest first. I’m sure the transformation must be draining on your body. It’s a little grotesque looking. 


SETANTA
Oh, I guess I’ve never had the chance to look at my reflection while transformed. And if I have, I wouldn’t remember. 


SCATHACH
I wouldn’t recommend it. 


FERDIAD
Come on, Cu Chulainn, let’s go get something to eat and celebrate the progress you’ve made. 


(FERDIAD and SETANTA exit. SCATHACH goes to monitor her other pupils. A scream is heard.) 


SCATHACH
What’s going on? 


(An injured pupil enters, limping, with two other pupils supporting him.) 


PUPIL
He got caught in a trap. We got him out of it, but he’s badly injured and losing a lot of blood. 


INJURED PUPIL
Sorry, I didn’t know these were a part of our training... I would have been more careful...


SCATHACH
They aren’t. I haven’t set up any traps. I check every single morning to make sure there are no traps. She must have done this earlier today. Maybe while I was distracted with testing Cu Chulainn. 


PUPIL
She? Do you know who did this? 


SCATHACH
Get inside the fortress and get his wounds treated by the physician. Go, you only have as much time to lose as he has blood to lose! 


(The three pupils exit.) 


SCATHACH
Everyone, stop sparring. There’s just been a report of a trap that caused a serious injury. I need you to check the grounds for more traps with me, so no one else has to be injured by things that aren’t my training. 
________________
Scene 7 


(Still the training grounds, but weeks later. The pupils are sparring and SCATHACH is monitoring them like normal. SETANTA and FERDIAD enter.) 


SETANTA
Ugh, time to fail again. 


FERDIAD
Don’t be a self-fulfilling prophecy. 


SETANTA
I already am, that’s kind of my whole deal. 


FERDIAD
I mean be optimistic! You can do this, I believe in you. 


SETANTA
You’re really good at making that sound sincere. 


FERDIAD
I am sincere. 


SETANTA
I’m betting Scathach isn’t. 


SCATHACH
Yeah, I can’t say I’m all that optimistic. I do still think you can achieve your goal eventually. But this time specifically? Eh. 


SETANTA
Let’s just get this over with. I’m ready to be humiliated again. 








SCATHACH
You still need to put in your full effort. These potions aren’t cheap to make. I’ll have to import more ingredients soon. 


SETANTA
Okay, I’ll try. 


(SETANTA and SCATHACH start sparring.) 


SCATHACH
You know, I’m starting to think you’re not even worth those potions at all. I’d be better off selling them as sleep aids. Maybe I’ll just send you home if you’re going to waste my money like this. 


(SETANTA loses his cool. Like a reflex, SCATHACH puts the potion in his mouth and he calms down.) 


SCATHACH
That was- 


SETANTA
I know, pitifully short. I’m hitting a wall here. You said I just need to practice practice practice, but there’s only so much I can practice something the wrong way. 


FERDIAD
What do you think’s making it hard for you? 


SCATHACH
Have you been taking notice of how you feel just before you transform? 


SETANTA
Let me think. It’s not just anger, actually. It’s fear. Even when you’re teasing me about silly things, I still know you could kill me if you wanted to. There’s a part of me that’s paranoid you actually hate my guts and I know if that were true I’d be doomed and I guess that risk just activates my fight or flight response. 


SCATHACH
I see. Yet it’s that power gap that makes it possible for me to safely deal with you after triggering you. 


SETANTA
And once I’m back out in the real world, there’s still going to be life and death situations where that small part of me is convinced the only way to survive is to let the dark magic protect me. I don’t know what to do. 


FERDIAD
Be confident in yourself? 


SETANTA
I admit I have a bit of an ego, but there are times I wouldn’t take that gamble. Especially knowing my destiny. 


SCATHACH
These are valid points. I have an idea. There may be a way for you to have the option of quickly killing your opponent, while still retaining your logical faculties and memories. A weapon. I have a magic spear, forged from the bones of a sea monster I slayed. When it pierces skin, the tip spreads poison barbs all throughout the victim’s body, causing an instant and brutal death. 


SETANTA
Woah. And you want to give this to me? 


SCATHACH
It’s probably for the best that I’m no longer in possession of it, anyway. If my fortress were to get raided or infiltrated, it could fall into the wrong hands. Not that I usually have to worry about that, but... Anyway. 




SETANTA
Okay, so, you obviously aren’t going to let me use it during our battles though, right? 


SCATHACH
No. Killing me isn’t actually an option I want you to have. But think of it this way. You can rest easy knowing that if you pass the test, you’ll be safe out in the real world too. And me trusting you with this rare, dangerous, magical item has to assuage your paranoia somewhat, doesn’t it?


SETANTA
Yeah. You have a point. Yeah, I think I do feel better now. 


FERDIAD
Yeah, that’s the spirit! 


SETANTA
Okay, I’m ready to try again if you are. 


SCATHACH
I like your enthusiasm. Sure, let’s go. Impress me. 


SETANTA
Yes ma’am! 


(They begin sparring, but this only lasts for a little bit before they’re interrupted by a scream.) 


SCATHACH
What now? 


(An injured pupil limps in, panicking.) 


INJURED PUPIL
Scathach! There’s an intruder! She knocked out most of us that were training over there. I just barely managed to escape to warn you! 


SCATHACH
Oh. Damn it, of course. I need to get the Gae Bulg spear. 


(SCATHACH exits, then returns.) 


SCATHACH
It’s not in its case. She must have gotten to it already. This does not bode well. Everyone here is in serious danger. I’m sorry, my pupils. I’m supposed to guide and nurture you. I’m supposed to be strong enough to protect you. 


SETANTA
What exactly is going on? 


(AIFE, a woman who closely resembles SCATHACH, enters holding the magic spear. All of the pupils except for SETANTA and FERDIAD run away to hide from her.) 


AIFE
Hello, Scathach. 


SCATHACH
Leave my pupils alone and get out. Now. 


AIFE
I’m just here to make a simple request. Honor it and they will be safe. Okay? 


SCATHACH
And what is that? 


AIFE
I want my castle back. 


FERDIAD
Your what? 


SETANTA
Scathach, I thought this was your castle. 


SCATHACH
It is. She’s just being delusional. 


AIFE
I mean, sure, maybe my memory is failing me. So correct me if this series of events is false. We grew up on this island, in this castle, together with our father. Being the same age, it wasn’t always clear who would inherit it. But our father, before he passed, granted that right to me so that I could raise my own family here like I always wanted. Which is something I can’t do while you’re hosting hundreds of young warriors here and having them constantly fighting all over the grounds. And yet you went ahead and did that anyway once he was dead and couldn’t order you to stop. 


SCATHACH
You don’t have any actual right to this property. You want to raise a family, fine, there are a million places you could do that. Go marry a man who owns a castle and move in with him like most ladies do. Where else in the isles could I do what I’m doing? 


AIFE
I don’t want just any castle. This is my childhood home. This is our family’s legacy. I need to carry it on. You just want to desecrate it by inviting in random youths of any culture and bloodline. 


SCATHACH
That reaches more people than just reproducing- Okay. No. We’ve had this debate plenty of times before. This is a distraction. The real argument here is about how you need to stop attacking my pupils who have nothing to do with this and no idea who you are. Talking about how this place is too dangerous to raise children when you’re the reason it’s so dangerous. 


AIFE
They should know who I am. You can’t erase me from my own home. 


SCATHACH
I have a feeling we can’t settle this with words. 


AIFE
That’s one thing we’ll agree on. 


(SCATHACH unsheaths her sword to prepare for a battle. SETANTA and FERDIAD do the same and stand by her side.) 


SCATHACH
Cu Chulainn, Ferdiad, you need to get to safety like the others. Let me handle this. 


SETANTA
But we can help you! You’ll have a better chance of winning if it’s 3 against 1. 


SCATHACH
I hate my sister, but not quite enough to want her to get mauled to death after you lose control. She deserves something a bit more dignified. Though I’m not sure she would do the same for me. 


(AIFE tosses the magic spear to the side.) 


AIFE
No Gae Bulg in exchange for a one on one battle without the monster boy. 


SCATHACH
Deal. 


SETANTA
Come on, you can’t just make me sit out a battle on the sidelines when someone I care about is in danger. 


SCATHACH
Except I can make you. You’d be too antsy waiting for us to finish fighting? Fine. You don’t have to be conscious for it. Drink the sleeping potion. 


SETANTA
No, I don’t want to be asleep while a really important battle is- 


(SCATHACH forces the potion down his throat and doesn’t release him until he falls unconscious. She turns to FERDIAD.) 


FERDIAD
You don’t have to force me! I’ll take it. 


(SCATHACH hands him the potion. He drinks it and collapses next to SETANTA.) 


#10 COME TO THIS
	

SCATHACH
It’s time for you to pay for your betrayal, Aife. For attacking innocents unprovoked. Including myself. 


AIFE
You? An innocent? And I’m the betrayer? 


(AIFE unsheathes her sword.) 


AIFE
DON’T MAKE ME LAUGH
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID
YOU SET US ON THIS PATH
THAT KILLED THE BOND WE HAD AS KIDS


(AIFE lunges forward, beginning the fight.) 


SCATHACH
YET YOU’RE ON THE ATTACK
WHILE I’VE BEEN MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS
THERE’S NO GOING BACK


AIFE
I’M NOT LOOKING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS


SCATHACH & AIFE
YOU LYING, BACKSTABBING THIEF
I CAN’T BELIEVE
I GREW UP WONDERING 
HOW I GOT SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AS A SISTER
BUT WHAT I’M WONDERING
NOW IS HOW IT COULD HAVE COME TO THIS
WE WERE BORN TWO OF A KIND
THE SAME IN BODY, HEART, AND MIND
NOW EVERYTHING’S AMISS
AND IT’S YOUR FAULT IT’S COME TO THIS


AIFE
ALL OUR LIVES PEOPLE ASKED
WHICH ONE OF US IS STRONGER
NOW THAT WE WON’T HOLD BACK
LET’S NOT WAIT ANY LONGER


SCATHACH & AIFE
I CAN FINALLY PROVE THAT IT’S ME
I STILL CAN’T BELIEVE
I GREW UP WONDERING 
HOW I GOT SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AS A SISTER
BUT WHAT I’M WONDERING
NOW IS HOW IT COULD HAVE COME TO THIS
ONLY YOU COULD UNDERSTAND
BEING A GIRL WITH POWER SO GRAND
NOW EVERYTHING’S AMISS
AND IT’S YOUR FAULT IT’S COME TO THIS


(They put their entire focus into fighting. After a while, they both start to get worn down. It’s a stalemate until AIFE finally gets the upper hand. She laughs maniacally.) 


AIFE
Would you look at that! We finally know which twin is stronger! 


(AIFE’s sudden yelling disturbs SETANTA’s sleep. He opens his eyes. He discretely turns to look at AIFE and SCATHACH.) 


SCATHACH
The battle isn’t over yet. 


AIFE
Technically the battle has been going for quite a while, so this is the beginning of the end of the end. And you’ve been losing this whole time. 


(SETANTA tenses up, getting angry. He relaxes when he spots the magic spear. He very slowly crawls over to it.) 


SCATHACH
I CAN’T BELIEVE
I GREW UP WONDERING 
HOW I GOT SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AS A SISTER
BUT WHAT I’M WONDERING
NOW IS HOW IT COULD HAVE COME TO THIS


AIFE
You know exactly how. 


(SETANTA reaches the spear. He grabs it, jumps behind AIFE, shoves her off of SCATHACH, then pins her down while holding the spear right up to her throat.) 


AIFE
What?! Was that potion a fake? Are you really that dishonorable? 


SCATHACH
No, I’m as confused as you are. Wait... The potion is potent enough to put a human to sleep. It could be that- 


SETANTA
My monster side is useful after all. That and being a demigod. And just generally awesome. 


SCATHACH
I should have given you more. What’s wrong with me these days? 


AIFE
Yeah, you idiot. How did you not expect this? 


SETANTA
Hey! You might not want to be so rude while you’re inches away from a brutal death. 


AIFE
As if you’d actually do it. 


SETANTA
Regardless of what Scathach thinks about your dignity, I’ve decided that if you continue your evil ways, you’re too dangerous to be allowed to live. How many of my peers have you brutalized? How can I in good conscience risk more of their lives? 




AIFE
Oh. I see the fury in your eyes. I recognize that fury just as much as I recognize my castle and my spear. What can I do to get this weapon away from my throat? 


SETANTA
Just a simple request. 


STOP THIS FOOLISH FIGHTING
BEFORE YOU BOTH LOSE WHAT YOU WANT
WAS THE SCHEMING AND THE HIDING 
WORTH IT IF YOUR LIFE IS GONE


I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE
CAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SEE TWO MIRROR IMAGES
MORE ALIKE THAN DIFFERENT, TWO SISTERS
WHOSE COMBINED STRENGTH IS LIMITLESS
YET RIGHT NOW SOMEHOW IT'S COME TO THIS
YOUR POWER WASTED IN MUTUAL DESTRUCTION
WHAT A POOR WAY TO MAKE YOUR INTRODUCTION
EVERYTHING'S AMISS 
BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE TO COME TO THIS


AIFE
Maybe we could have been stronger together if she didn’t betray me. 


SCATHACH
I could say the same thing about you. 


SETANTA
Okay, what if... Scathach, you won’t need this place forever, right? You’ll eventually retire from teaching. 


SCATHACH
I suppose. 




SETANTA
You should do more with your life before you die. See the world, relax, make new friends. 


AIFE
So I have to wait until she’s an old lady to live here with my family? 


SETANTA
Well, what if Scathach takes summers off and you can use it as a vacation home? 


SCATHACH
If that’s what it takes for her to stop ruining everything the other three quarters of the year. 


SETANTA 
I’ll put my weapon aside if you two do the same. 


AIFE
Fine. I accept your conditions. 


(AIFE and SCATHACH both lay their swords down. SETANTA pulls back the spear and takes the swords.) 


SETANTA
And... 


SCATHACH
What? 


SETANTA
I want you to hug each other and say you’re sorry. 


SCATHACH & AIFE
No! 




AIFE
I’m not sorry. This has been a decently successful negotiation for me, all things considered. 


SETANTA
I guess that’s a good thing. 


SCATHACH
I still don’t trust her. But fortunately, I don’t really have to. We’ll put this agreement on parchment and have a fae bind us to it. 


AIFE
So fairy magic will kick you out of the castle on every Beltane? I would love that. 


SETANTA
Great! Hey Scathach, what did I tell you? I was helpful after all. And I didn’t go berserk. 


SCATHACH
That was impressive. I think that means- 


SETANTA
Holy shit! I completed my training! I did what Emer’s father asked me to do in exchange for her hand in marriage! 


SCATHACH
Congratulations, my pupil. I will write a letter confirming your progress and achievements for you to show him when you return home. 


SETANTA
Thank you! Can you do that right now? I want to get back as soon as I can. I’ve kept Emer waiting for far too long. I feel terrible. 






SCATHACH
You’ll be missed. But I understand. Looks like I have two urgent documents to write. Aife, come with me. You can’t be trusted out of my sight until the contract is complete. 


AIFE
Wait, there’s still a boy passed out over there. Are we not going to wake him? 


SCATHACH
Oh. Right. 


AIFE
He must have been expecting to wake up to at least one dead body and his last conscious thoughts must have been worrying about whose it will be. He’s going to be so confused. I have to see this. 


SETANTA
I’ll do it. For different reasons though. 


(SETANTA shakes FERDIAD awake.) 


SETANTA
Hey! Hey! The sleeping potion can’t be that strong, can it? 


AIFE
Pathetic, inferior non-demigods. Can’t hold their potions. 


(FERDIAD opens his eyes and sits up groggily.) 


FERDIAD
Huh? Who won? Wait, what? 


(AIFE bursts out laughing. SCATHACH rolls her eyes and pulls her along. They both exit.) 






SETANTA
I intervened in the fight without transforming and I got them to negotiate a truce! I proved myself! I can go home now. 


FERDIAD
Wait, what? I mean, congratulations, but go home? Why? 


SETANTA
I completed my mission. 


FERDIAD
You... That can’t have been the only thing keeping you here, right? Like, isn’t there anything else valuable that you might want to stick around for? 


SETANTA
This has always been my top priority. I came here with a goal and I achieved it. I made a promise to the person I love most in the world. I have to return to her. I can’t spend any more time making her miserable from missing me. 


FERDIAD
Right. Wouldn’t want anyone important to you missing you and feeling miserable because you left. 


SETANTA
I’m glad you understand. 


FERDIAD
Wait, but- Wait, wait, wait, okay. So you had to prove you can fight without losing control of yourself. But you’re leaving after succeeding just once? Doesn’t he need to see that you can pass the test several times to prove it’s not a fluke? That’s what I thought you were trying to do. 


SETANTA
Yeah but I have a new plan now, a plan that works. And a letter from the mentor he sent me to and a legendary, one-of-a-kind, magic spear she gifted me. What else does he need? 


FERDIAD
I don’t know, like... Damn it. I just don’t want you to go. I’m closer with you than I am with anyone else here. I thought you felt the same. 


SETANTA
I do. That’s why we’ll fight side by side one day, remember? 


FERDIAD
Oh right, I agreed to defect from Connacht’s army to join you in fighting for Ulster if they go to war. 


SETANTA
Exactly. 


(SCATHACH enters and hands a scroll to SETANTA.) 


SETANTA
Thank you, Scathach! For everything. And Ferdiad, we’ll see each other again. I promise. It may happen sooner than you think. 


(SETANTA exits. SCATHACH follows after him.) 


#11 LIKE IT MEANT NOTHING
	

FERDIAD
But should I? I really thought you were worth it. Maybe I was wrong. 


(FERDIAD starts crying. He wipes his tears and takes a deep breath to stop himself.) 




FERDIAD
HOW COULD I FALL ASLEEP 
ASSUMING WHEN I WAKE YOU WOULD STILL BE WITH ME?
HOW COULD YOU THROW THIS ALL AWAY 
LIKE IT MEANT NOTHING? 
WOULD IT HAVE BEEN SO HARD TO STAY?


I WAS READY TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING FOR YOU
BUT YOU CAN BARELY MUSTER UP A REAL GOODBYE
HOW CAN I KEEP MY DIGNITY? 
AS YOU NONCHALANTLY PACK UP AND LEAVE
AS I WATCH MY FANTASIES DIE


HOW COULD I HAVE THOUGHT
IT’D BE OKAY TO LET MYSELF GET ATTACHED? 
HOW COULDN’T I HAVE KNOWN HOW IT WOULD END?
LIKE IT MEANT NOTHING
ALL THIS TIME WERE YOU JUST PLAYING PRETEND? 


TOSSED ASIDE LIKE I ALWAYS AM
WHY DID I THINK YOU’D BE DIFFERENT?
I’M STAYING AS CALM AS I POSSIBLY CAN
PLAYING NICE EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN’T
BUT MAYBE THAT’S TOO GENEROUS
FOR SOMEONE WHO LEFT ME IN THE DUST
I’LL HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN WHEN I SEE YOU AGAIN
I’LL BE WITH A GIRL I KNOW WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT REVENGE


HOW COULD YOU HAVE THOUGHT
YOU’D GET AWAY WITH BREAKING MY HEART? 
I CAN’T JUST LET YOU RUN AWAY
LIKE IT MEANT NOTHING
I’LL SHOW YOU WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED
BECAUSE IT MEANT SOMETHING
IT MEANT EVERYTHING TO ME


AND KNOWING ALL THE WHILE YOU’D LEAVE
THE MOMENT YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED
YOU STILL LET ME BELIEVE
IN ALL THOSE MOMENTS THAT WE BONDED
I’LL KEEP YOU TO YOUR WORD THAT YOU’LL SEE ME SOON
WITH A LESSON FOR YOU TO LEARN
BECAUSE IF IT MEANT NOTHING TO YOU
I CAN ONLY RESPOND IN TURN

Scene 8


(The fortress where FORGALL and EMER reside. There are guards inside, including LUGAID. SETANTA enters with the scroll and spear.) 


SETANTA
I’m back! Emer! 


(EMER enters. For a split second she doesn’t believe what she’s seeing, then she shrieks and runs into his arms.) 


EMER
Setanta! Finally! I’m so glad you’re okay! 


SETANTA
You wouldn’t believe the day I’ve had. I’ll tell you all about it. And then we’ll get married! 


(FORGALL enters.) 


FORGALL
You again? How are you here? 


#11A PROVE YOURSELF (REPRISE)
	

SETANTA
I PROVED MYSELF
I DID EXACTLY AS YOU ASKED
I TRAINED ACROSS THE SEA
GOT APPROVAL TO COME BACK
AND SHOW YOU ALL THE BRAND NEW ME
NOW THAT I’VE EARNED YOUR TRUST AND PROVED SHE’LL BE JUST FINE
I’M GOING TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER
I DID THE WORK AND NOW IT’S FINALLY TIME


(FORGALL groans in frustration.) 


FORGALL
Guards, take Emer back to her room. So I can speak to the boy in private. 


(Two guards grab EMER and pull her away from SETANTA.) 


EMER
No! You need to keep your word! 


FORGALL
I really don’t. 


SETANTA
What? Sir, you have nothing to fear about me anymore. Scathach whipped sense into me just like you said she would. I have it in her words. 


(SETANTA gives the scroll to FORGALL, who opens it and rips it up without reading it.) 


FORGALL
Nothing you can do would ever make me trust you with my daughter. 


SETANTA
Then why did you send me to train? 


FORGALL
Because I expected you to not come back alive. Clearly, I’ve been disappointed. Do the next best thing and leave my fortress and never speak to my daughter again. 


EMER
No! 




SETANTA
I’m afraid I won’t be doing that, sir. 


FORGALL
Guards. 


LUGAID
We can’t remove him, remember? 


FORGALL
At least restrain him. Get him unconscious somehow- I don’t care how you have to do it- and dump him outside. 


(Reluctantly, some of the other guards try to tackle SETANTA. LUGAID backs away.) 


SETANTA
I should warn you that even though now I can avoid transforming if I don’t want to, there can still be times I do want to. 


FORGALL
Threatening the man you want to be your father-in-law? That only makes me even more sure you can’t be trusted. 


SETANTA
You’ve made it very clear that we’re beyond the point of trying to salvage your opinion of me. 


FORGALL 
Then give up and leave! 


SETANTA
Not after I sacrificed so much over a lie! 


(The guards holding EMER attempt to pull her off-stage but she struggles. SETANTA goes berserk. He fatally injures the guards restraining him as he shakes them off. Just as the other guards have almost exited with EMER, SETANTA lunges toward them. He injures them while pulling them off of EMER, but she’s unharmed. FORGALL and LUGAID run off, terrified. Once all guards are either gone or incapacitated, SETANTA calms down and hugs EMER.) 


EMER
I hate my father. I’m so glad he was wrong. 


SETANTA
So... I guess we’ll elope? 


EMER
We have no other choice. I think we’ll never be welcome here ever again, after what you just did. 


SETANTA
I’m sorry. 


#12 RUN AWAY
	

SETANTA
I wanted to solve this peacefully. 


EMER
I know. 


BUT OUR FUTURE IS IN OUR HANDS NOW
WE’RE FINALLY FREE
NO MORE TRICKS OR ASKING PERMISSION
IT’S ALL UP TO YOU AND ME
AFTER ALL THOSE MONTHS WE SPENT 
LIVING ON A SINGLE SHRED OF HOPE
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS HAVING YOU HERE WITH ME
SO BE IT IF WE HAVE TO ELOPE
WE CAN EMBRACE OUR WILD SIDES
FIND A COZY PLACE TO HIDE
SOMEWHERE FOR JUST YOU AND I
TO LIVE THE NEXT CHAPTER OF OUR LIVES
WE’LL MAKE SURE THOSE TRIALS WEREN’T IN VAIN
LET’S RUN AWAY


SETANTA
LET’S RUN AWAY


(Holding hands, they run off. Once they’re gone, LUGAID comes back on.) 


LUGAID
ARE THEY REALLY JUST RUNNING AWAY? 
THOSE COWARDS, THOSE FOOLS
MUST THINK THEY’RE ABOVE THE RULES
YOU WALTZ IN, WRECK EVERYTHING, AND LEAVE LIKE IT’S ALL COOL
YOU MUST THINK JUSTICE DOESN’T EXIST
I’D BE HAPPY TO PROVE YOU WRONG
YOU THINK YOU HAVE A HAPPILY EVER AFTER
WELL IT WON’T LAST FOR LONG
SOMEONE’S GOTTA MAKE YOU PAY
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN RUN AWAY


(A MESSENGER enters with a letter.) 


LUGAID
A letter? This is kind of a bad time. Where is it from? 


MESSENGER
The Isle of Skye, sir. 


LUGAID
Again? But Cu Chulainn doesn’t reside there anymore. 


MESSENGER
It’s actually from Scathach, addressed to Cu Chulainn. I guess this was the one address she thought she could reach him through because of his fiancee. Would you be able to get it to either of them? It’s apparently an urgent warning. 


LUGAID
Of course. I’ll see to it right away. 


(The MESSENGER gives the letter to LUGAID and leaves.) 


LUGAID 
A warning, huh? Well, let’s see what danger awaits that fiend. 


(SCATHACH enters to give voice to the letter she wrote.) 


SCATHACH
Dear Cu Chulainn...


YOU MAY HAVE SOLVED MY CONFLICT 
BUT I THINK YOU JUST CAUSED YOUR OWN
I FOUND FERDIAD FUMING 
AND HE SAID HE'D RUN AWAY BACK HOME
AND I SWEAR I SAW HIM SCHEMING
HE HAS A PLAN FOR WHEN HE GETS THERE
SOMETHING ABOUT A QUEEN WHO KNOWS 
HOW TO MAKE THINGS FAIR
I DON'T TRUST HIS MOTIVES IF HE'S KNOCKING ON A TYRANT'S DOOR
BE PREPARED, I FEAR THIS MIGHT MEAN WAR


(SCATHACH exits.) 


LUGAID
Interesting. I might have just found myself an ally. It sounds like he’ll be in Connacht. 


IF IT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO MAKE HIM PAY
MAYBE IT’S TIME I RUN AWAY


(The ghosts of the slain guards rise to change the scene from inside of a fortress to the outside of a castle. FERDIAD enters. The ghosts exit.) 


LUGAID
You! You’re also waiting for an audience with the queen? 


FERDIAD
Yes. 


LUGAID
Would you happen to be Ferdiad, former friend of Cu Chulainn? 


FERDIAD
Uh, yes. How did you know that? 


LUGAID
I traveled to Connacht to find you. I’ve been betrayed by him too, and I heard you have a plan for vengeance. I want in. 


FERDIAD
Yes, I have a plan. 


THERE WERE NIGHTS WE STAYED UP LATE
WHISPERING SECRETS
AND HE MADE A FATAL MISTAKE
HE TOLD ME HIS KINGDOM'S WEAKNESS
THE KING PISSED OFF A GODDESS
HE WON A RACE AGAINST HER BY BEING DISHONEST 
NOW THE MEN IN THE ARMY ARE CURSED
IN BATTLE THEY'RE INCAPACITATED BY THE PAINS OF BIRTH
AND I KNOW A QUEEN WHO HATES THAT KING
WHO'D LOVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT KIND OF THING
SO IF WE TALK TO HER I'M SURE
SHE'LL HELP US, SHE'D EVEN START A WAR


LUGAID
LET’S START A WAR


(SETANTA and EMER enter on the other side.) 


SETANTA & EMER
LET'S RUN AWAY
MAKE OUR STRUGGLES NOT IN VAIN
WE CAN FINALLY LIVE THE LIFE WE EARNED
EVEN IF SOME BRIDGES HAD TO BE BURNED 
LET'S RUN AWAY


FERDIAD & LUGAID
SOMEONE’S GOTTA MAKE YOU PAY
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN RUN AWAY


(SCATHACH enters again.) 


SCATHACH
HE'S KNOCKING ON A TYRANT'S DOOR
BE PREPARED, I FEAR THIS MIGHT MEAN WAR


FERDIAD & LUGAID
LET'S START A WAR 


SETANTA & EMER
LET'S RUN AWAY


FERDIAD & LUGAID & SCATHACH
THIS MEANS WAR

ACT TWO 
Scene 1


(QUEEN MEDB’s throne room. FERDIAD and LUGAID enter. They bow to her.) 


FERDIAD
Your majesty! We come seeking your aid. 


MEDB
My aid? You should know my time and resources are very valuable. What could possibly be so important? 


(She looks at them dismissively, then her expression changes as she recognizes FERDIAD.) 


FERDIAD
Well- 


MEDB
Wait. Is that you, Ferdiad? I didn’t expect you again for a while. 


FERDIAD
Yes, something happened while I was away training. My heart was broken. I was betrayed. Then I met someone with a vendetta against the same guy I was hurt by. 


MEDB
Oh, that would be why there’s someone beside you I’ve never seen before. Normally that would mean he’s entirely irrelevant. 


LUGAID
My name is Lugaid, your majesty. I was almost a victim. I watched as Cu Chulainn slaughtered my fellow guards while kidnapping a girl. 




FERDIAD
Cu Chulainn was my training partner for the last few months. We bonded very quickly, but it was all a lie. He made promises he didn’t intend to keep. As soon as he got what he wanted out of training, he abandoned me to marry that girl. And killed Lugaid’s colleagues in the process. 


LUGAID
That’s why we’d like your help in killing him. 


FERDIAD
Wait, wait! I don’t think we’re on the same page there. 


MEDB
Oh. Please decide exactly what you’re asking me for before you come into my throne room requesting aid. 


FERDIAD
I thought we agreed I would do most of the talking. So my plan takes precedent. 


LUGAID
Fine, I’ll shut up. As long as we get some kind of vengeance. 


FERDIAD
I think Cu Chulainn’s cruel actions can be explained by a case of hubris. He let his successes go to his head to the point that he doesn’t think of anyone else, not even the person closest to him. He needs a wake up call, something to make him realize he isn’t some invincible god who the world revolves around. We need to attack, and he needs to lose, and I also need the catharsis of punching the boy who made me cry. I mean, I’ve already punched him a lot, obviously, but this time will be filled with raw emotion and justice. Basically, we need a war. Connacht versus Ulster. I know there’s something in that for you, too. Especially since I found out Ulster’s army is cursed and vulnerable. 


#13 QUEEN OF REVENGE
	

MEDB
Oh, wonderful! Yes, yes, I understand perfectly. 


YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE, MY FRIEND
I JUST HAPPEN TO BE THE QUEEN OF REVENGE
A BROKEN HEART HAS ONLY ONE WAY TO MEND
AND NO ONE DOES IT BETTER THAN THE QUEEN OF REVENGE


IF YOU STAY DOWN WHEN YOU’RE HURT
YOU SEND A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD
NO ONE NEEDS TO FEAR YOU, YOU’RE WORTH 
NOTHING 
BUT IF YOU FIGHT BACK
SUDDENLY THEY PAY ATTENTION
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE ATTACK
SUDDENLY YOU’RE SOMETHING


MEDB & FERDIAD
THEY FEAR 


MEDB
AND THAT MY DEAR 
IS WHY WE GET REVENGE


SO FOLLOW ME, THE QUEEN OF REVENGE
ONTO THE BATTLEFIELD WHERE WE’LL MEET 
THAT BOY THAT YOU ONCE CALLED A FRIEND
AND THE MAN THAT I ONCE CALLED A HUSBAND
AND THERE THEY’LL FIND THEIR REWARD FOR HOW THEY TREATED US


MEDB & FERDIAD
WE WON’T LET THEM FORGET 
WE’LL FILL THEIR HEARTS WITH REGRET


WE DON’T STAY DOWN WHEN WE’RE HURT
WE SEND A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD
EVERYONE SHOULD FEAR US
AND KNOW OUR WORTH
WATCH AS WE FIGHT BACK
AND WE’LL HAVE THEIR ATTENTION
IT’S TIME TO READY OUR ATTACK
YOU AND I


FERDIAD
THE LOVER THAT GOT LEFT BEHIND


MEDB 
AND THE QUEEN OF REVENGE


FERDIAD
REVENGE 


MEDB & FERDIAD
REVENGE


MEDB
Boys, we have some scheming to do! I have been thinking of invading Ulster lately. My reason will be the public justification of my declaration of war. It’s recently come to my attention that my husband is slightly richer than me, breaking our agreement of always being equal in wealth. It’s a prize stud bull that he owns that tips the balance. I need one to match, and there just happens to be a valuable one over in Ulster I could take. 


FERDIAD
And Cu Chulainn is the only one who can fight back. The curse affects grown men, but like me, he’s only 17. 


MEDB
And I assume you want to be the one to smack some sense into him. 


FERDIAD
If anyone can get through to him, it’s me. 


MEDB
I’ll have my army wear him down so you can be his final opponent. 


FERDIAD
He’s really strong, but I don’t know if I want to risk him dying in battle before it’s my turn. 


LUGAID
I wouldn’t mind. 


MEDB
I’ll have them fight one on one until he’s sufficiently worn down for you. 


FERDIAD
Deal. 


#13A QUEEN OF REVENGE (PLAYOFF)
	

MEDB & FERDIAD & LUGAID
IT’S TIME TO READY OUR ATTACK
ALL THANKS TO THE QUEEN OF REVENGE

Scene 2


(Outside the castle of KING CONCHOBAR of Ulster, where he waits with his servants and guards. SETANTA and EMER enter nervously.) 


SETANTA
Your highness, you wanted to speak with me? 


CONCHOBAR
My worst nightmare is coming true. Ulster is under attack, with the men of our army still under a curse rendering them unable to fight. There’s only one youth I know of powerful enough to stand a chance defending us. We need you to be our hero, Cu Chulainn. 


SETANTA
I’ve been waiting to hear those words my whole life. See, everyone? I’m not just Culann’s guard dog. I’m not just my beautiful wife Emer’s guard dog. Now I’m the kingdom of Ulster’s guard dog. 


EMER
Wait! Why are we being attacked? What happened? 


CONCHOBAR
It’s my ex-wife. She sent me a letter, saying...


(A servant opens the letter. MEDB enters to echo her own words.) 


MEDB
My dear, piece of shit ex husband, 
I’m writing to you to let you know how fucked you’re about to be. You see, you have something I want and I’m going to come take it and there’s nothing you can do about it. To be more specific, the other day I was looking over the reports of my wealth and that of my new husband Ailil- who is much better in bed than you- but I noticed a small problem. He has a prize stud bull that’s so valuable it technically makes him richer than me. And I do not like that. So I figured I should get one of my own. But where will I find one? I can’t just buy one, that wouldn’t increase my wealth. So I figured, I’ll steal one, and if anyone deserves to be stolen from, it’s you, you- 


CONCHOBAR
You can stop there. The rest is just a long string of immature insults and threats. 


(MEDB rolls her eyes and leaves.) 


SETANTA
So she’s invading Ulster just to take a bull. 


EMER
Why don’t you just give it to her so she’ll leave without hurting anyone? 


CONCHOBAR
That would set a dangerous precedent. It tells her she can do whatever she wants, walk all over us, and receive no consequences. That’ll only encourage her to do worse things in the future. 


EMER
But if you try to fight back, she’ll just find out how weak the kingdom’s defenses are, and that’ll only encourage her more than if you keep that secret by avoiding a fight. 


CONCHOBAR
But we do have defenses. We have Cu Chulainn. 


SETANTA
Yeah! We have me! 


CONCHOBAR
Do you doubt the heroism of your own husband? 


EMER
No, of course not, but...


CONCHOBAR
Look! Off in the distance, if you squint, you can see the front lines of her army already marching towards us. That’s the threat we need you to defend us from, Cu Chulainn. 


#14 ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY
	

SETANTA
IS THIS IT? IS IT ACTUALLY TIME? 
TO BE THE HERO WITH MY KINGDOM ON THE LINE
THE CHOSEN ONE TO STAND UP TO THE VILLAIN
AND TRIUMPH DESPITE ODDS OF ONE IN A MILLION


I’VE JUST BEEN CAST AS THE STAR OF THE STORY
THIS COULD BE MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY
I’M READY FOR WHAT FATE HAS IN STORE FOR ME
I’M READY FOR MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY


CONCHOBAR & SERVANTS 
IT’S TIME FOR YOU TO BE OUR ONLY HOPE 
OF VICTORY OR EVEN JUST SURVIVAL
OR AT LEAST THAT’S WHAT WE’LL TELL OURSELVES TO COPE
WITH AN INVADING ARMY’S IMMINENT ARRIVAL


SERVANTS
NEVER THOUGHT YOU’D BE THE ONE WE HAVE TO TRUST
CU CHULAINN YOU’D BETTER PROTECT US


SETANTA 
DON’T WORRY, I’LL BE THE DEFENDER YOU NEED
SOON YOU’LL CELEBRATE MY HEROIC DEEDS


CAUSE I’VE BEEN CAST AS THE STAR OF THE STORY
THIS COULD BE MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY
I’M READY FOR WHAT FATE HAS IN STORE FOR ME
I’M READY FOR MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY


SERVANTS 
YOU ARE OUR ONE CHANCE
THOUGH YOU AREN’T THE STAR WE’D CAST


SETANTA
I AM YOUR ONE CHANCE
THIS IS MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY
AND I’LL TAKE WHAT FATE HAS IN STORE
THIS IS THE PROMISED GLORY I’VE WAITED FOR
EVEN IF I’M AFRAID
I’M FOLLOWING UP ON THE CHOICE I MADE
AND I’LL BE THE HERO THEY NEED
SO ONE DAY THEY’LL CELEBRATE ME
ONE DAY THEY WILL PASS ON MY STORY
IN EXCHANGE I’LL DIE FOR MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY


EMER
Setanta, wait! What if this fulfills the prophecy? 


SETANTA
The short life and glorious death? Yeah, this is the kind of ending I’d want. Giving my life as my kingdom’s sole protector. And the longer I last against the army, the more glorious it will be, so I’m sure I’ll hold my own for quite a while. Maybe even win with my sacrifice. 


EMER
But we only just got married. 


SETANTA
You married me knowing I’d have a short life. 


EMER
But I thought we’d at least have more time than this to enjoy it. We won’t even have children. 


SETANTA
I’m sorry, Emer. But we knew we can’t pick the details. Only accept what fate wants to offer. 


CONCHOBAR
You should get ready to meet the invaders. Get your armor and weapons. 


SETANTA
Right. 


(CONCHOBAR and his court exit. SETANTA kisses EMER, then he leaves to follow them.) 


#15 WHY SO SOON
	

EMER
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR
OR YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO CARE AGAIN
YOU'LL REGRET IT WHEN YOU SEE YOUR 
HEART STRIPPED BARE WITH NO DEFENSE 


WORDS THAT FELL ON MY DEAF EARS 
THEY JUST DON'T GET IT
I WANT THE TEARS
I WANT THE PAIN, THE LONGING, THE YEARNING 
WATCHING AS THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING
I WANT THE DREAD, THE MISERY, THE FEAR


THE GREATEST LOVE STORIES ARE TRAGEDIES
THE DEEPEST LOVE IS THE LOVE THAT MAKES YOU CRY
WITH THE STRENGTH OF A STORM IT BRINGS YOU TO YOUR KNEES
NOW I HAVE IT YET I'M ASKING WHY
WHY, WHY SO SOON
HAVE WE ALREADY REACHED OUR IMPENDING DOOM
IT'S OKAY IT'S OKAY IT'S OKAY
BUT WHY SO SOON


BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR
YOU’LL WISH YOU NEVER CARED AT ALL
CAUSE WHEN THE FUTURE KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR
THERE’S ONLY SO LONG THAT YOU CAN STALL


WELL OPEN UP, I’M READY NOW
IS WHAT I WISH I COULD SAY AS IT CHASES ME DOWN
AND NOW A PRIMAL FEELING INSIDE ME IS BURNING
SLOWLY REVEALING SOMETHING RATHER CONCERNING
I WANT TO FIND THE HAPPIEST FATE THAT FATE WILL ALLOW


IF OUR STORY IS TRAPPED IN A PROPHECY
IS THERE ANY ENDING WHERE HE DOESN’T DIE
IF THERE’S NOT, IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE TIME FREEZE
SO I’M NOT LEFT WONDERING WHY
WHY, WHY SO SOON
HAVE WE ALREADY REACHED OUR IMPENDING DOOM
I’LL BE OKAY BUT HE WON’T BE OKAY
WHY SO SOON


IF HIS LIFE IS SHORT BUT HIS LEGACY IS GLORIOUS
I’LL STILL BE LEFT BEHIND NOT QUITE FEELING VICTORIOUS
ALL OUR LOVE AMOUNTS TO IS A MEMORY
IF SOON HE DIES MAYBE SO WILL I
WE’LL REUNITE AS HEROES IN THE SKY
THEN I CAN TRULY JOIN HIM IN THIS DEADLY LEGACY


IF THERE’S NO ESCAPING YOUR IMPENDING DOOM
MY LOVE I WILL FOLLOW YOU
I’M JUST STILL WONDERING WHY SO SOON

Scene 3


(The battlefield. MEDB arrives with her army.) 


MEDB
So, Conchobar! Where’s your champion? You are going to put up a fight, aren’t you? I hadn’t assumed you were that pathetic. 


(SETANTA enters, wearing armor and wielding the magic spear. EMER clings onto him.) 


SETANTA
I’m here. And I’m ready to fight. Emer, please, you have to get to safety so I can protect everyone. 


EMER
Promise me you’ll try to solve this peacefully. 


MEDB
Oh? 


SETANTA
She’s not usually like this. 


EMER
We’re not usually face to face with an invading army. Fine, I’ll go. 


(EMER storms off.) 


SETANTA
She has a point, though. This doesn’t seem like the kind of conflict that should be settled with a war. 


MEDB
What? Why not? 




SETANTA
Because- and forgive me for being rude, but you are the one attacking us- it’s ridiculously petty. 


MEDB
Not to me. It’s the most important thing in the world from my perspective. 


SETANTA
And what about all your soldiers who have to risk their lives trying to achieve something they probably don’t give a shit about? It’s petty to them. Yet they’re the ones with the most to lose. 


MEDB
You know what? I think I’d like to have a private chat with you for a bit. Soldiers, go retreat somewhere out of earshot. Go loot some villages for all I care. 


(The Connacht soldiers salute to her then march off.) 


SETANTA
Can I actually convince you if you aren’t worried about saving face in front of the people you rule over? 


MEDB
Sure, tell yourself that if it makes you a little less scared. No, about those soldiers, you’re right that there isn’t much in this for them. If you’re half as powerful as I hear, many will certainly lose their lives for my whims. 


SETANTA
And you have just enough empathy not to admit that out loud right in front of them. 








MEDB
Just enough. But no more. Because the beautiful thing about being royalty is that I don’t have to care about that. All I have to care about is whether I win in the end. 


SETANTA
You are awful. 


MEDB
Maybe if you had more of a way with words, you actually might stand a chance of convincing me. Too bad. 


#16 NO ONE ELSE MATTERS
	

SETANTA
Listen. 


I WAS KIND OF BUSY JUST LIVING MY LIFE
I DIDN’T EVEN GET TO ALL THE SEASONS
WHY DON’T YOU COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME TO FIGHT
ONCE YOU HAVE A BETTER REASON
IN WAR YOU HAVE TO JUSTIFY WATCHING PEOPLE DIE
BUT YOU’RE ONLY HERE TO SATISFY YOUR GREED AND PRIDE


MEDB
That’s right! 


OH LOOK AT YOU ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY
IF YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE YOU’RE WELCOME TO FIGHT ME
AND WHILE YOU’RE AT IT ALSO MY ARMY
THOUGH I’M SURE NEXT TO THEM YOU MUST FEEL TINY


SETANTA
IS THERE NOTHING I CAN SAY TO MAKE YOU GO AWAY?


MEDB
No. 


SETANTA
NOT EVEN A DELAY? 


MEDB
No. 


UNLESS YOU FIGHT I’M HERE TO STAY


LISTEN BOY, GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD THAT I DON’T CARE
IF A THOUSAND DEATHS IS THE PRICE OF MAKING THINGS FAIR
CAUSE WHEN YOU’RE AT THE TOP YOU WON’T STAY THERE
IF YOU STOP TO LOOK BEYOND IMPORTANT AFFAIRS
ALL THESE SOLDIERS WERE MADE FOR DYING FOR THEIR QUEEN
THEY FIGHT FOR WHATEVER I WANT, THAT’S WHAT THAT MEANS


YOU CAN SAY I HAVE NO SOUL
I’M FINE WITH THAT IF I’M IN CONTROL


NO ONE ELSE MATTERS


SETANTA
That’s not true! 


MEDB
BUT IT IS
NO USE FOR FLATTERY
YOU KNOW THEY’RE ALL USELESS
NO ONE ELSE MATTERS
THEY’RE NO BETTER THAN PAWNS
WATCH HOW THEY SCATTER
OH IT JUST MAKES ME YAWN


NO ONE, NO ONE, NO, NO ONE ELSE MATTERS
BUT THE BIG PLAYERS WHO EARNED THE RIGHT TO CALL THE SHOTS
WE’RE AMONG THE SPECIAL FEW THAT DO MATTER
I DUNNO ABOUT YOU BUT I SURE LIKE IT A LOT


SETANTA
You are such a narcissist. I’m nothing like you! 


MEDB
Ha! It’s not narcissism if it’s true. 


I MIGHT AS WELL BE A GODDESS
CAUSE THEY ALL KNOW THAT I GOT IT
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE WAS ONCE SOMETHING I WANTED
AND WHEN YOU WANT IT YOU TAKE IT
EVERYONE ELSE GOTTA FAKE IT
ONLY REAL LEGENDS KNOW YOU WANT A LEGACY GO MAKE IT


YOU CAN SAY I’M OUT OF MY MIND
WELL I’D RATHER BE CRAZY THAN FALLING BEHIND


NO ONE ELSE MATTERS
YOU CAN’T ARGUE WITH THIS
NO USE FOR FLATTERY
YOU KNOW THEY’RE ALL USELESS
NO ONE ELSE MATTERS
THEY’RE NO BETTER THAN PAWNS
WATCH HOW THEY SCATTER
OH DOESN’T IT MAKE YOU YAWN?


MEDB
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO, NO ONE ELSE MATTERS
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO, NO ONE ELSE MATTERS
SETANTA
NO! NO! NO! NO!


NO! NO! NO! NO!




MEDB
NO ONE ELSE MATTERS AS LONG AS I’M VICTORIOUS
AS LONG AS I’M REMEMBERED AS POWERFUL AND GLORIOUS
I’LL LET MY NARCISSISM TAKE THE REIGNS
IF EVENTUALLY I HAVE TO DIE 
AT LEAST LET ME MAKE THE MOST OF BEING ALIVE
AND WHEN I’M BETRAYED LET ME MAKE THEM PAY FOR ALL THAT PAIN
THAT’S WHO I AM, A FEARSOME WARRIOR QUEEN, AND THAT WILL NEVER, EVER CHANGE! 
CAN YOU STILL SAY WE’RE NOT THE SAME? 
CAN YOU STILL SAY WE’RE NOT THE SAME? 


SETANTA
I get it! There’s no reasoning with you. Whatever, I want to fight too anyway.  


MEDB
There we go! 


SETANTA
Let’s just get this over with.


MEDB
Aw, don’t look so glum. It’d be boring if my troops all destroy you at once. You can fight one at a time. 


SETANTA
Seriously? 


MEDB
Hey! You guys can come back now! I hope they didn’t wander too far. If they assumed it would take a long time for me to get what I want from you, then I might just kill a few of them before you can.  


(The Connacht soldiers return.) 


MEDB
Welcome back. It’s finally time for battle! You will each have the chance to face the enemy champion in one-on-one matches. Who wants to go first? 


(The soldiers look at each other. SETANTA readies his spear. Those who recognize it flinch and back away. Impatient, MEDB points at a soldier.) 


MEDB
You! Be the first to fight Cu Chulainn and show Ulster the power of Connacht! 


(The chosen soldier cautiously approaches SETANTA, trying to appear brave and tough. It only takes a few seconds of exchanging blows for SETANTA to strike the soldier in the flesh with his spear, fatally wounding him. The soldier goes limp and collapses to the ground.) 


SETANTA
Yeah, who wants to be next! 


MEDB
Good job, Cu Chulainn. I hope you have the energy to do that ten thousand more times. 


SETANTA
Of course I do. 


#16A ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY (REPRISE)
	

(One by one, soldiers come forward to fight SETANTA. Each time, it takes a bit longer for him to be able to land the killing blow. He gets more tired as time goes on while each new opponent has the same level of energy. Ghosts of slain soldiers sit with their backs to the audience, continuing to sing with the other soldiers.) 


SETANTA
SO THIS IS WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE THE STAR OF THE STORY


SETANTA & SOLDIERS
THIS COULD BE MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY




SETANTA
I’M READY FOR WHAT FATE HAS IN STORE FOR ME


SETANTA & SOLDIERS
I’M READY FOR MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY
I’M READY TO BE THE STAR OF THE STORY
THIS COULD BE MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY
I’M READY FOR WHAT FATE HAS IN STORE FOR ME
I’M READY FOR MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY


(Two Ulster soldiers sneak in to watch how it’s going. They see that SETANTA is starting to get worn down, though he’s trying not to show it.) 


SETANTA & SOLDIERS
I’M READY TO BE THE STAR OF THE STORY
THIS COULD BE MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY
I’M READY FOR WHAT FATE HAS IN STORE FOR ME
I’M READY FOR MY ONE CHANCE FOR GLORY


SETANTA
I’LL TAKE WHAT FATE HAS IN STORE
THIS IS THE PROMISED GLORY I’VE WAITED FOR
EVEN IF I’M AFRAID
I’M FOLLOWING UP ON THE CHOICE I MADE
EVEN IF I’M TIRED
I HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE GLORY I DESIRE


Even if I’m-


(SETANTA passes out from blood loss. When the music stops, the dead soldiers also go limp on the ground. The two Ulster soldiers rush over to stop a living Connacht soldier from taking the magic spear and killing him.) 


MEDB
Wait. 


(As one of the Ulster soldiers picks up the unconscious SETANTA, MEDB draws her sword and takes a swing at the other one. He draws his own sword to protect himself, then doubles over in pain, clutching his stomach. MEDB laughs as she puts her sword back in its sheath.) 


MEDB
So it is true. I love this. 


(The Ulster soldiers carry SETANTA away.) 


MEDB
We should probably do something about this pile of corpses before he gets back, huh? 


(She looks to her living soldiers, who seem reluctant.) 


________________


Scene 4


(SETANTA wakes up in a field hospital, with EMER and the soldiers who saved him by his side.) 


SETANTA
Where am I? Did I die? 


EMER
No, you’re healing from your wounds. 


SETANTA
Queen Medb let them take me back to heal? 


EMER
Apparently. I’m not sure what goes through her head, but if she’s allowing this we may as well take advantage of it. 


SETANTA
Huh. Well, now that I’m awake, I guess I’d better get back to fighting. 


(SETANTA tries to get up but EMER holds him down.) 


EMER
No! You’re not fully healed yet. Look. 


SETANTA
Oh. But I feel... okay. 


EMER
Just okay. You should be feeling your best when you go take on another round. It’ll just exhaust you again. 


SETANTA
I’m fine. I can fight. And we can’t assume Medb’s patience will last forever. Let me get my armor. 


(SETANTA gently moves EMER away from him so he can get up unimpeded.) 


EMER
Why won’t you listen? No one ever listens to me. 


SETANTA
Sorry Emer, I’m just trying to be the hero of our otherwise defenseless kingdom. 


EMER
I thought you promised you’d be my hero before anything else. 


SETANTA
Up until my inescapable destiny, and, well... I didn’t expect it to come so soon either. 


EMER
You could at least try to put it off. 


SETANTA
I don’t want to look like a coward. I don’t want people to think I regret accepting my destiny. 


EMER
You don’t regret it? Even when it’s making me feel like this? 


SETANTA 
I didn't expect that you would feel that way. 


EMER 
I didn't either. I'm sorry, but... I try so hard to be the cool girl who doesn't care too much and lets you do whatever you want. And for the most part, that's fine, because I know you'd do the same for me. But I have to draw the line here. I love you too much to watch you recklessly endanger yourself. 


SETANTA
Then don't watch. Just stay off the battlefield like everyone else, okay?  


#16B EMER’S PRAYER
	

(A man brings him his armor and spear. As he puts on the armor, EMER kneels and prays.) 


EMER
OH PLEASE SOMEONE CONVINCE THIS BOY
THERE’S MORE TO SUCCESS THAN DESTROYING YOURSELF
IN THE PURSUIT OF DESTROYING SOMETHING ELSE
MAKE HIM QUESTION IF THE THRILL OF BATTLE IS WORTH
EVEN SOONER BEING BURIED IN THE EARTH
HE MAY BE STRONG AND VALIANT AND SKILLED
BUT THAT WON’T PREVENT HIS BLOOD FROM BEING SPILLED
SOMEONE PLEASE CONVINCE THIS BOY 
HE’S MORE THAN JUST A TOY FOR FATE
TO BE ENTERTAINED BY THEN THROW AWAY
CONVINCE HIM TO LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY
AT LEAST FOR MY SAKE
OH OH OH


(The god LUGH appears before her.) 


EMER
Oh. Hello. 


LUGH
I’m here to answer your prayer. 


EMER
Someone actually listened. 


LUGH
Of course. You’re my daughter-in-law. 


EMER
Ah, right. Of course. Thank you. 


LUGH
I’m sorry I couldn’t be there at your wedding. 


EMER
It’s okay! My family wasn’t either. Um, anyway. Are you going to talk some sense into your son? 


LUGH
Setanta! 


(SETANTA and the other men turn to look. Their jaws drop when they see LUGH. SETANTA runs up to him.) 


SETANTA
Dad! Hey! It’s been way too long. Have you come to watch my feats of heroism that will be retold for generations, just like yours? 


LUGH
Sort of. I am very proud of you, Setanta, but I am also concerned. Your wife is right, you need to rest before you begin fighting again. 


SETANTA
What? But we’re gods! 


LUGH
Yes. But even gods need rest. 


SETANTA
That makes no sense. 


#17 EVEN GODS NEED REST
	

LUGH
LOOK AT YOU STILL BATTERED AND BRUISED
YOU THINK IT’S WORSE TO BACK DOWN THAN IT IS TO LOSE
IT’S NOT A SURPRISE I WAS ONCE JUST LIKE YOU
YOUNG AND RECKLESS WITH SOMETHING TO PROVE
THEN I GREW UP WHICH YOU WON’T GET TO DO
SO I SHOULD SHARE WHAT I LEARNED TO BE TRUE


YOU CAN WIN ALL THE BATTLES AND PASS ALL THE TESTS
BUT THE TRUTH STILL IS EVEN GODS NEED REST
YOUR DIVINE BLOOD IS STAINING YOUR CLOTHES
YOUR SELF-NEGLECT IS ONLY HELPING YOUR FOES
YOU’RE A BRIGHT LIGHT ABOUT TO BURN OUT
FORGETTING WHAT YOUR LIFE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT


YOU HAVE THE POWER OF A GOD BUT YOU’RE DOOMED JUST LIKE A HUMAN
YOU’RE GIVING YOUR ONLY LIFE DEFENDING WHAT ONE DAY WILL ONLY BE RUINS


EMER
YOUR RECKLESS AMBITION DESTROYS YOUR BODY BUT IT ALSO BREAKS MY HEART
THOUGH I SUPPOSE I’M JUST AS MUCH TO BLAME HAVING KNOWN IT FROM THE START
BUT NOW THAT I SEE THE PRICE FOR MYSELF OF WHAT IT COSTS TO BE THE BEST
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU DON’T REALLY NEED THAT, WHAT YOU NEED IS TO REST


LUGH & EMER
EVEN GODS NEED REST


SETANTA
Hold on for a second, dad! 


WHO ARE YOU TO LECTURE ME
ABOUT STAYING SAFE WHEN THE WORLD IS IN NEED
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HERO OF YOUR TALES
WHO TAUGHT ME THAT COURAGE NEVER FAILS
DID YOU LOSE THE LESSONS WHEN YOU PASSED THEM ON
IS THE BRAVE VERSION OF YOU REALLY GONE


LUGH
THAT’S THE PROBLEM WITH STORIES, SON
YOU KEEP GROWING AFTER THE TELLING IS DONE
BUT THE TELLERS DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVEN’T HEARD
SO THE LINE BETWEEN YOU AND THE HERO IS BLURRED
AND THE DISTANCE GETS FARTHER AS TIME PASSES ON
UNTIL EVENTUALLY, YES, THE OLD YOU IS GONE


YET FROZEN IN TIME AND MORE WELL-KNOWN
AND TREATED AS MORE REAL THAN YOUR OWN FLESH AND BONE
SO TAKE YOUR TIME TO DECIDE WHO YOU WANT TO BE
IN YOUR LAST CHANCE TO BE THE STAR OF A STORY
THE MORE YOU RUSH THE MORE RISK OF REGRET
WHEN THERE’S NO UNDOING THE ENDING YOU GET


LUGH & EMER
THERE’S NO UNDOING THE ENDING YOU GET
THERE’S NO UNDOING THE ENDING YOU GET


SETANTA
Okay. I know what I have to do. I want to be the kind of hero you used to be. And if I’m running out of time, I have to go out and make a good impression while I still can. 


LUGH
Wrong answer. 


SETANTA
How did my father become such a coward? Is it because you're immortal? You think that just because you can avoid death, you should?






LUGH
Yes! How can my son be so ungrateful for the divine genetics I passed down to you? You're putting your potential as a demigod to waste.


SETANTA
Because I know the only way to truly live forever is to be remembered. With your new attitude, you'll never do anything memorable ever again. And in 2 thousand years, if you're still alive but no one ever thinks of you, you might as well not be. 


LUGH
Oh, right, because in your 17 years of existence, you've become wiser than the god of light!


EMER
Hey, god of light. Don't you have any other ways of getting him to stop? Cause this one doesn't seem to be working.


LUGH
Yes. Of course. If my words won’t convince you, maybe magic will. I’ll put a sleeping spell on you. 


(LUGH places his hand on top of SETANTA’s head. This makes SETANTA drowsy, but he tries to stay awake.) 


SETANTA
I’m resistant to sleep magic, you know. Not even sleeping potions can keep me down for long. 


LUGH
Maybe a lullaby would help? 


EMER
I’ll try. 


#17A DEEP DOWN (REPRISE)
	

I’M HERE, MY DARLING, AND I WILL STAY
FOR AS LONG AS YOU NEED ME TO SHOW YOU THE WAY


(As she sings, SETANTA slowly stumbles to the ground. EMER sits and puts his head on her lap so he can be comfortable while he involuntarily falls asleep. She strokes his hair.) 


EMER
I HOPE YOU CAN STILL SEE ME SO I’LL LOOK RIGHT THROUGH 
THE HERO AND SEE YOU, JUST YOU
JUST YOU


I think he’s asleep now. How long will it keep him down for? 


LUGH
Should be around 3 days. But there’s no telling for sure with him. I’ve seen plenty of demigods in my time, but there’s something special about him that makes him unpredictable. 


EMER
Yeah. I know. He is special. I’m really going to miss him. But I guess I should try to feel the way I thought I’d feel when I first found out what kind of person he is. Just grateful I got to be part of the story of someone so extraordinary. If I outlive him, I’ll at least spend the rest of my life with some great memories and a sense of pride. For now, he’s right here, and I’ll try to cherish that.

Scene 5


(A field close to a village. LUGAID and some Connacht soldiers walk across smugly, carrying bags of loot from other villages. Their way is blocked by a group of children and young teenagers training to become soldiers.) 


TRAINEE
We won’t let you into our village! 


CONNACHT SOLDIER
Aw, why not? 


TRAINEE
We know what you’ve done to the others. You’re awful! And we won’t let that stand here! 


TRAINEES
Yeah!  


CONNACHT SOLDIER
If only your hero Cu Chulainn weren’t sleeping right now, maybe he could help you with that. Too bad though. Outta my way, brats. 


TRAINEE
He may not be here, but we can still stop you! 


(The Connacht soldiers laugh in disbelief.) 


CONNACHT SOLDIER
A bunch of kids who haven’t completed their training? 


TRAINEE
Cu Chulainn is a teenager and he’s been doing a fine job kicking your butts so far. 




CONNACHT SOLDIER
You are not Cu Chulainn. 


TRAINEE
We can be like him if we try. 


TRAINEES
Yeah! 


CONNACHT SOLDIER
Fine, fine, if you insist on making me a child murderer, go ahead and try to stop us. 


TRAINEE
Charge! 


(The young soldiers in training run at the Connacht soldiers with their weapons drawn. The Connacht soldiers draw their own weapons and easily kill the trainees.) 


CONNACHT SOLDIER
It's nice to have an easy win for once. 


CONNACHT SOLDIER 2
Yeah, it's refreshing. 


LUGAID
Really gets the morale back up after that disastrous start. 


(The other soldiers murmur in agreement as they all exit, leaving behind the pile of dead children. One of the trainees is barely alive and tries to get up but fails.) 


TRAINEE
Cu Chulainn, please wake up soon... 


(The barely alive trainee lays back down. After a few moments of waiting, SETANTA enters with EMER, but neither sees the pile of dead children at first.) 


EMER
Just don't push yourself too far this time. 


SETANTA
I'll be fine! I'm totally rested and healed, just like you wanted. My dad's sleep magic really is something. And your lullaby. 


EMER
Thanks. I know you'll do great. 


(SETANTA lets go of EMER and turns to return to battle. He takes a step then freezes when he sees the dead children.) 


SETANTA
What... happened here? 


EMER
Oh my gods. 


(The barely alive trainee raises himself up just enough to be noticed.) 


TRAINEE
Cu Chulainn! You came! 


SETANTA
What happened? Did Medb's army attack you? 


TRAINEE
We tried to fight them. We didn't do very good. 




SETANTA
Why? I'm the one who was appointed to protect you and fight on everyone's behalf. You didn't have to put yourself in danger. 


TRAINEE
I wanted to be cool and brave like you. You're young too but you still do so much. But I guess I'm not as strong as you. I know, it was stupid... 


(The trainee coughs as he runs out of blood and starts to lose consciousness.) 


SETANTA
No. Those monsters shouldn't have done this to you. Every kid is stupid but it shouldn't have to end in this. They knew they were playing dirty. They didn't care how unfair it was. 


TRAINEE
I'm at least glad you're here, to be the hero we couldn't be. Thank you. 


(The trainee loses consciousness. SETANTA kneels down beside him.) 


SETANTA
Yeah, I'm here now. But I wasn't there when I needed to be. 


EMER
You were rest- 


SETANTA
Enough about that! Please. I know I can't change the past. These regrets are just another part of my story now. But what I can do is avenge them. And I have a feeling I'll do a much better job of that than the enemy army planned for. 




EMER
You go get 'em. 


SETANTA
Hey! Any Connacht bastards still around? I'm awake! 


(The Connacht soldiers return. EMER finds a standing stone to hide behind.) 


CONNACHT SOLDIER
Oh, you saw the results of the mini game. Glad the main event is back. 


SETANTA
You fool! 


(SETANTA steps toward them, hunching over, his breathing getting heavy. Some of them realize what's happening and their eyes widen. The ghosts of the children rise up and exit.)


SETANTA
Have you not heard the legends of Cu Chulainn, the monster demigod whose battle frenzy leaves a trail of destruction and carnage with no mercy for the likes of you?


(SETANTA goes berserk. He rushes at the Connacht soldiers and attacks the one at the front, who struggles greatly to defend himself.) 


CONNACHT SOLDIER 
Hey! Are any of you cowards going to help? 


LUGAID 
But the one on one agreement! 


CONNACHT SOLDIER
Forget the agreement! This is a special circumstance! 


LUGAID 
The most important one hasn’t even-


(As SETANTA kills the first Connacht soldier, all the others freak out and start trying to attack him all at once. Some try to take his spear from him but fail. He easily kills a bunch of them. Others scatter but he chases them and attacks. Only LUGAID manages to escape. EMER cheers, still watching from a safe distance behind a tall standing stone. LUGAID returns with FERDIAD.) 


#19 EVEN NOW
	

FERDIAD
Hey, Cu Chulainn. 


(When he sees FERDIAD, SETANTA freezes and snaps out of his frenzy. The fatally wounded guards sneak away to exit.) 


SETANTA
Ferdiad? You're here. I didn't think- Wow-


FERDIAD
I'm not here to fight alongside you, if you're still under that delusion. 


SETANTA
What? So why are you- Wait, are you fighting for Queen Medb? Why?  


FERDIAD
EVERYTHING’S AMISS
AND IT’S YOUR FAULT IT’S COME TO THIS






SETANTA
What are you talking about? What happened? We used to be so close. 


FERDIAD
Yeah, exactly! That's why I remember that all the time, you would tell me that what you want most in life is for people to look up to you as a hero, to idolize you, to love you. And there I was, supposedly exactly what you wanted. Someone who'll remember you forever. And yet look at what that got me! I didn't get to be remembered. You forgot me. 


SETANTA
I didn't forget you! I think about you all the time. I just thought that fate would bring us back together. 


FERDIAD
That’s not enough! 


I USED TO WONDER HOW I GOT SO LUCKY AS TO HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE
BUT WHAT I’M WONDERING NOW IS HOW I CAN BE AS IMPORTANT TO YOU AS YOUR WIFE


SETANTA
That’s what this is about? 


FERDIAD
FOR HER YOU’D BREAK YOUR OTHER BONDS
LIKE THEY MEANT NOTHING AND NEVER DID
YOU LET HER BLIND YOU AND NOW SOMEHOW YOU
EXPECT THE SAME LOYALTY YOU WOULDN'T GIVE


SETANTA
Please calm down, I didn’t know it mattered that much. 


FERDIAD
PLAY INNOCENT IF YOU WANT BUT IT JUST MAKES IT WORSE
IF IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO YOU I MIGHT FEEL HURT


SETANTA
Look, I’m sorry, but I had to leave. Why get stuck on that? We’re together again. We don’t have to be enemies. 


FERDIAD
EVEN NOW
AS WHAT WE HAD COMES CRASHING DOWN
YOU WON’T ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT’S HAPPENING
EVEN NOW
AS I’M CRYING OUT TO YOU
YOU WON’T ADMIT WHAT YOU DID TO ME
NOW I SEE
I WILL NEVER BE YOUR PRIORITY
NEVER THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR STORY
THAT GIRL YOU MARRIED IS THE ONE YOU GAVE THAT LUXURY
YOU ONLY HAVE ROOM FOR ONE FIRST PLACE IN YOUR LIFE AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME


(FERDIAD draws his sword and lunges forward. SETANTA blocks him with the spear, sharp end facing away from FERDIAD.) 


SETANTA
Woah! 


EVEN NOW
AS THE WORLD IS BURNING DOWN
THAT’S WHAT YOU’RE ASKING OF ME
EVEN NOW
THAT’S ALL YOU THINK ABOUT
AND NOT HOW YOU’RE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY
I CAN’T BELIEVE
WHEN I SAW YOU HERE I FELT SO RELIEVED
I THOUGHT I’D HAVE YOU BY MY SIDE AGAIN LIKE WE AGREED
BUT INSTEAD YOU’RE HERE ON A MISSION AS PETTY AS YOUR QUEEN’S




FERDIAD
DON’T DISMISS MY FEELINGS
YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND THAT PAYBACK IS A NEED
BUT EVEN NOW
ALL I WANT IS TO BE IMPORTANT
TO BE THE FIRST THING PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY THINK OF YOU
THERE MIGHT BE JUST ONE WAY TO DO THAT


(FERDIAD keeps attacking SETANTA, who defends himself with the spear and only attacks with the wrong end.) 


FERDIAD
IF THE END OF YOUR DESTINY IS COMING SOON


SETANTA
YEAH SURE, KILL ME, THAT’LL SHOW YOU CARE


FERDIAD
THAT’S THE PROBLEM, I CARE MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
IT’S A FITTING END, BUT I SWEAR I WISH
IT DIDN’T HAVE TO COME TO THIS


SETANTA
IT DIDN’T HAVE TO COME TO THIS


FERDIAD
IF IT DIDN’T HAVE TO COME TO THIS


(FERDIAD stops fighting and SETANTA stops too.) 


FERDIAD
DO YOU WANT THINGS TO BE LIKE THE WAY THEY WERE?
DO YOU WANT AN END TO THIS WAR?


SETANTA
YES
TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU
AND FIX THIS MESS


FERDIAD
THERE’S ONE OTHER WAY TO HEAL MY HEARTACHE
SO PLEASE HEAR OUT MY SIMPLE REQUEST
UNDO YOUR MISTAKE AND COME BACK 
AND RESET TO BEFORE YOU PASSED THE TEST


(SETANTA hesitates and looks back at EMER, who is still spectating but frozen from shock at the situation.) 


SETANTA
But what about-


FERDIAD
LEAVE BEHIND YOUR WIFE
AND THE LIFE YOU MADE WITHOUT ME
THAT’S THE ONLY WAY TO ERASE MY DOUBTS
THAT YOU EVER CARED ABOUT ME
PLEASE COME WITH ME


SETANTA
That’s crazy! I won’t break my vows over your hurt feelings. I care about you so much but that doesn’t mean you can expect me to throw away everything else I’ve fought for! 


FERDIAD
SO EVEN NOW SHE COMES BETWEEN US
EVEN NOW SHE’S THE ONE YOU CHOOSE
EVEN WHEN YOU CAN REPAIR MY TRUST
YOU DON’T AND I’M SO CONFUSED
MAYBE I COULD SOLVE THIS ISSUE
MAKE THE CHOICE A BIT EASIER FOR YOU
I BET IF SHE WASN’T IN THE WAY I’D RISE UP 
FROM SECOND PLACE, NOW LET’S SEE IF THAT’S TRUE


(FERDIAD looks at EMER and side steps SETANTA to rush towards her, weapon at the ready.) 


SETANTA
No!!! 


(SETANTA reacts quickly and stabs FERDIAD in the back with the sharp end of the spear. FERDIAD gasps and falls over and drops his own weapon. SETANTA, horrified at what he just had to do, drops down onto his knees beside him.) 


FERDIAD
Oh... So that’s... 


SETANTA
YOU’LL NEVER BELIEVE ME BUT I SWEAR I DIDN’T WANT IT TO COME TO THIS


FERDIAD
AND NOW EVERYTHING WILL STAY AMISS
BUT IN A WAY IT’S FINE
IF I CAN’T HAVE YOU I WOULD RATHER DIE


SETANTA
I’m sorry.


FERDIAD
Me too. 


MAYBE I AT LEAST EARNED A PLACE IN A WARRIOR’S PARADISE UP ABOVE
THEN I HOPE- NO, I PROMISE, I WILL SEE YOU SOON, MY... 


(FERDIAD’s breath runs out and he goes limp.) 


SETANTA
Yeah. See you soon. 


(SETANTA looks up at LUGAID. Like EMER, he’s so overwhelmed by what he just witnessed that he’s just kind of frozen.) 


SETANTA
Hey. Take his body back to your camp and give him a proper warrior’s burial. 


HE WON’T BE JUST ANOTHER BODY ON THE BATTLEFIELD FORGOTTEN
LET HIM KEEP HIS DIGNITY EVEN AS THANKS TO ME HE’LL SOON BE ROTTING


(LUGAID wordlessly obeys him. Terrified, he gets out of there with FERDIAD’s corpse as quickly as he can. EMER cautiously approaches SETANTA, sits next to him, then hugs him as he cries.) 
________________


Scene 6


(At the field hospital, SETANTA is resting, too lethargic from grief to get up and fight again. EMER comes in and sits down with him in somber silence for a bit.) 


EMER
How are your wounds? It looks like you’re healing up pretty well. 


SETANTA
Oh. I guess so. 


EMER
I’m not going to rush you into fighting again, obviously, but... This is unlike you. 


(SETANTA sits up to look at her incredulously.) 


SETANTA
Why are you surprised? You saw what happened. I killed my closest friend. I know this is war, I know I jumped in head first, but I never, ever wanted this. We talked about fighting side by side when we're older. Being heroes, being  glorious together. We had dreams of a future that fate was never going to grant us. We'll never get to do that. We won't ever get to grow up. And it's all my fault. He could have been so much more than this, if only I was more than... what I am. He should have had more time. Oh. Wait. Is this how you're going to feel when fate comes for me next? I'm so, so sorry, Emer. 


EMER
Setanta. Please don’t be so hard on yourself. You didn’t have a choice. He was attacking us and wouldn’t listen. 






SETANTA
But how did it get to this in the first place? This isn’t how things are supposed to go. I can’t keep people I care about from getting killed. Friends become enemies. Enemies stay enemies. The people who rely on me literally have no other choice. And now the prophecy of my death is probably about to be fulfilled. 


EMER
The prophecy that said you’re destined to be glorious when you die. You’ll still be a hero. 


SETANTA
What if we assumed that’s what it meant, but it doesn’t? This already isn’t what I wanted from my destiny. People I care about are becoming collateral damage to my selfish desire for fame. 


EMER
There might be room in your destiny to write in the details you want, then. You can become the hero you think you should be. 


#20 WHAT KIND OF HERO
	

SETANTA
Can I? 


I ALWAYS DREAMED OF BEING A LEGENDARY HERO
IT’S WHAT I MADE MY WHOLE LIFE ABOUT
NOW I VERY WELL MAY BE PART OF A LEGEND ONE DAY
BUT A HERO? I HAVE MY DOUBTS


WHAT KIND OF HERO KILLS HIS CLOSEST FRIEND?
WHAT KIND OF HERO CAN’T ACHIEVE A HAPPY END? 
WHAT KIND OF HERO IS WILLING TO WIN AT SUCH A COST? 
CAN ANYTHING EVEN BE A VICTORY AFTER WHAT I LOST? 


THIS IS THE NAME I’VE MADE FOR MYSELF
THIS IS THE STORY THAT WILL BE TOLD
I DON’T THINK THERE’S TIME TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE
MY FLAWS HAVE BEEN SET IN STONE


AND WHEN PEOPLE TELL MY STORY THEY’LL ASK THEMSELVES
WHAT KIND OF HERO IS A MONSTER DEEP DOWN
WHAT KIND OF HERO KILLS SOMEONE HE CLAIMS TO CARE ABOUT
THE KIND THAT WAS ONLY CHOSEN TO FIGHT BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE CAN
FOREVER THEY’LL BELIEVE THAT’S THE KIND OF HERO I AM


THIS IS THE FATE I CHOSE
I WAS FINE WITH LETTING IT DESTROY ME
BUT I DIDN’T KNOW
IT WOULD DRAG HIM DOWN WITH ME
AND NOW AS THE END APPROACHES
KNOWING THAT I CAN’T BREAK FREE
I HAVE JUST ONE HOPE
TO CHANGE WHAT PEOPLE SEE


(SETANTA attempts to stand in spite of his lethargy. EMER springs up to help him.) 


WHAT KIND OF HERO AM I? 
ONE THAT’S RUNNING OUT OF TIME
TO ENSURE HOW I’LL BE REMEMBERED
A MONSTROUS AGGRESSOR OR SELFLESS DEFENDER
I SHOULD TAKE CONTROL WHILE I STILL CAN
OF WHAT KIND OF HERO I AM


(Villagers, cursed soldiers, and ghosts of slain trainees enter like a Greek chorus.) 


CHORUS
WILL YOU PROVE YOURSELF? 
PROVE YOURSELF


(SETANTA, now standing, takes his spear.) 


SETANTA
I’LL DO MY VERY BEST, I’LL DO WHATEVER IT’LL TAKE
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF MY KINGDOM FROM HARM
THEY’LL REMEMBER THE LIVES I SAVE AND NOT JUST THE ONES I’VE SLAIN


CHORUS
WILL YOU SAVE US? 


SETANTA
THERE’S MORE TO ME THAN A MONSTER, I’VE GOT COURAGE, I’VE GOT CHARM
AND NOW IT’S TIME TO PROVE IT


CHORUS
WILL YOU PROVE YOURSELF? 


SETANTA
I WILL PROVE MYSELF FOR THE LAST TIME
SO I CAN BE PROUD OF THE ANSWER WHEN I ASK “WHAT KIND OF HERO AM I?” 


EMER
That’s the hero I fell in love with. I know you can do this. 


(They embrace and kiss.) 


SETANTA
Thank you for everything. Remember me. 


(EMER just nods, tears in her eyes but smiling.)

Scene 7


#20A QUEEN OF REVENGE (REPRISE)
	

(QUEEN MEDB’s throne room. She’s very clearly pissed off and lost in thought scheming. LUGAID enters and gets her attention.) 


LUGAID
Your majesty- 


MEDB
You don’t have to say it. 


I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED BUT I CAN’T COMPREHEND
THE UTTER STUPIDITY OF OUR ENEMY’S OFFENSE
DOESN’T HE KNOW BETTER THAN TO MESS WITH THE FRIENDS
OF THE INFAMOUS, UNSTOPPABLE QUEEN OF REVENGE
DOES HE KNOW THAT UNTIL NOW I WAS JUST PLAYING AROUND
AND HE JUST DECIMATED THE TIME IT’LL TAKE FOR HIM TO GET BURIED IN THE GROUND
WHEN YOU’RE FIGHTING ME YOU SHOULD WANT ME TO THINK WAR IS FUN
YOU’LL BE MISSING THAT ME ONCE THE REAL WAR’S BEGUN


AND TRUST ME IT’S ABOUT TO BEGIN


MEDB & LUGAID
AS PAYMENT FOR HIS SIN


WE DON’T STAY DOWN WHEN THERE’S JUSTICE TO BE SERVED
WE SEND A MESSAGE TO THE TRAITOR
THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN FEAR IF HE UNDERESTIMATES OUR WORTH
WATCH HIM REGRET IT AS WE FIGHT BACK
IT’S TIME TO READY OUR ATTACK
THIS LEGEND WILL BE NO MORE


LUGAID 
I’LL GET THE VENGEANCE I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR


MEDB 
HE’LL KNOW WHY I’M CALLED THE QUEEN OF REVENGE


AND THROUGH MY GRIEF 
I FIND A CAUSE FOR JOY
HE HANDED US THE VICTORY
HE’S JUST A FRAGILE BOY
IF HE HAS ANY OUNCE OF A SOUL
AND HE MUST HAVE TO HAVE EARNED OUR FRIEND’S LOVE
HE SACRIFICED HIS MORALS, HE LOST CONTROL
IT’S SPIRITUAL WEAKNESS WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF


LUGAID
HIS FAILURES AT BEING A HERO WILL CATCH UP TO HIM
IF EVEN HE CAN’T BELIEVE IN HIMSELF, HIS FUTURE LOOKS GRIM


MEDB 
THERE’S NO WAY HE CAN WIN THROUGH VIRTUE
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO A SO CALLED FRIEND


MEDB & LUGAID
WE’LL MAKE SURE HIS STORY IS ABOUT TO END
BY THE EXPERT HAND OF THE QUEEN OF REVENGE


(MEDB walks away from her throne.) 


MEDB
Let’s go tell the troops it’s finally time for our own glory. 


________________


Scene 8 


(A rocky battlefield. MEDB enters with LUGAID and her army.) 


MEDB
I demand to see your champion! 


(SETANTA enters, equipped with armor and his spear but still visibly broken inside.) 


SETANTA
I’m here. 


MEDB
Greetings. Remember how I let you fight my soldiers one at a time? You just lost that privilege. 


SETANTA
Oh. But didn’t you say that seeing them all destroy me at once would be boring? 


MEDB
It won’t be boring anymore. I will be watching with sadistic glee as I get revenge. 


SETANTA
I can’t say I blame you, I guess. 


MEDB
Ha! Look at you. Your mistakes are weighing on you and you’re weaker than ever. This will be so easy, like squishing a pesky spider. 


SETANTA
We’ll see how easy I make it for you. Whether or not I deserve to die, this kingdom that you’re attacking is still in danger. Maybe I won’t defeat your entire remaining army. But maybe I’ll whittle down the numbers so much that the people who are still here after I’m gone can actually stand a chance. 


MEDB
Good luck with that. Charge! 


#21 FINALE
	

(The army, with LUGAID at the front, attack SETANTA. He struggles to dodge and block and outmaneuver them all. He manages to hit a good number of them but they also manage to injure him quite a bit.) 


MEDB & LUGAID 
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
YOU WANT TO CALL YOURSELF A HERO? A HERO? 
WHAT KIND OF HERO KILLS HIS CLOSEST FRIEND? 
COULDN’T YOU WORK SOMETHING OUT AND BOTH GET A HAPPY END? 
YOU GAVE UP YOUR CHANCE FOR THAT WHEN YOU GAVE UP YOUR MORALS
FORGET HEROISM AND LOYALTY LET’S JUST HAVE A FREE FOR ALL


MEDB
EITHER GO ALL IN ON VILLAINY


LUGAID
OR PLAY BY THE RULES


MEDB & LUGAID
IF YOU GET STUCK IN THE MIDDLE THEN
YOU’RE TOO COWARDLY AND TOO CRUEL
WHERE’D THAT SHINING HOPE IN YOUR EYES GO
OF BEING A RESPECTED PARAGON
WE CAN TELL BY YOUR FACE YOU KNOW YOU’RE A DISGRACE
WITH BARELY THE WILL TO GO ON


(LUGAID grabs SETANTA’s spear and tries to wrestle it out of his hands.) 


MEDB & LUGAID & CONNACHT SOLDIERS


AND HOW CAN YOU FIGHT WITH HIS BLOOD STILL FRESH
ON THE VERY WEAPON YOU USED TO BETRAY HIM
HOW CAN YOU HOLD IT WITHOUT THINKING OF HIS ROTTING FLESH
ARE YOU THAT CALLOUS OR JUST DIM


(SETANTA breaks his spear in half and throws the halves. The half with the point hits a soldier and kills him. He quickly steals a sword from a dead soldier and continues to fight back.) 


MEDB
Ha! You just gave up the one major advantage you still had. 


SETANTA
I have something else. Just let me... Wait, why can’t I- What? I can’t transform! 


MEDB
Is it maybe because deep down, you feel that we’re right to attack you? That you’re not worth defending? 


SETANTA
Oh. But there is something still worth defending. I need to defend it. I need to... 


(Exhausted and bloody from the merciless onslaught of attacks, SETANTA stumbles and gets back up.) 


MEDB
Clearly, you won’t. 


(SETANTA struggles to keep standing as he continues to fight with the last of his energy.) 


SETANTA
I’M RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND BLOOD AND BREATH


MEDB & LUGAID & CONNACHT SOLDIERS
WHAT KIND OF HERO IS A TRAITOR?


SETANTA 
HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT CAN I MAKE BEFORE MY DEATH


MEDB & LUGAID & CONNACHT SOLDIERS
IS THIS YOUR FOOLISH ATTEMPT TO MAKE YOURSELF GREATER?
IF IT’S GLORY YOU SEEK
GIVE UP, NOW YOU’RE TOO WEAK


(SETANTA falls on the ground and can’t get up. He blocks attacks with his sword and looks around the battlefield. A standing stone catches his attention.) 


LUGAID
Time to say good night, Cu Chulainn. 


SETANTA
Wait, this isn’t glorious enough. 


(SETANTA drags himself over to the standing stone. He leans against it and manages to pull himself up into a standing position. He takes off his cape, wraps it around the stone, and ties himself to it.) 


SETANTA
I at least want to die fighting on my feet. 


I’M THE KIND OF HERO THAT KEEPS FIGHTING
EVEN WHEN I DON’T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO STAND
I MAKE MISTAKES BUT I WON’T GO INTO HIDING
FROM SHAME WHEN A HERO IS NEEDED AND I KNOW I CAN
BE THEIR PROTECTION REGARDLESS OF MY FLAWS
PUT THE PAST BEHIND ME AND CHAMPION A CAUSE
AND I BELIEVE THAT’S HOW I’LL BE REMEMBERED
AS A FEARLESS, SELFLESS DEFENDER
I THINK I’M FINALLY READY
WITH THE LAST OF MY POWER I’M STANDING STEADY
YEAH, I THINK I’M READY


(LUGAID approaches SETANTA. He stretches his non-sword-wielding arm out to stop the other soldiers from following.) 


LUGAID 
I call dibs on the killing blow. This is for my colleagues. 


(LUGAID tries to strike SETANTA. Their swords clash.) 


LUGAID 
You're surprisingly strong for someone who's bleeding out. Luckily for me I bet that isn't going to last for long. 


SETANTA
I got what I wanted. I'm not afraid. Go on, give me the glorious death I've been promised. If you... get the chance... before...


(SETANTA closes his eyes and stops moving. Confused, LUGAID stops attacking. MEDB approaches to get a better look.) 


MEDB
Is he dead? 


LUGAID
He's still holding his sword. Though maybe his muscles are just that tense. Maybe he's just that strong. 


MEDB
Well, there's one way to make sure. Off with his head! 


LUGAID
I'm going to relish this. 


(Just as LUGAID prepares to slash SETANTA's head off, SETANTA drops his sword. It hits LUGAID's wrist and cuts him deeply. LUGAID screams, drops his own sword, and steps back.) 


LUGAID
That is creepy as hell! I'll be back for revenge after I heal. 


(LUGAID clutches his bloody wrist and runs away.) 


MEDB
Ah well. Maybe there's another way. If he's not dead, he'll react to this. Attention people of Ulster! 


(EMER, KING CONCHOBAR, and some villagers and soldiers enter.) 


MEDB
Your hero has failed to protect you and left you defenseless to my invasion. It's time for me to secure my victory, steal that bull, and maybe kill my ex while I'm at it. Well, he's completely still and lifeless. I am still going to do all that though. I wasn't bluffing. 


(MEDB laughs maniacally as she sees her enemies cower in terror.) 


EMER
It might not be that easy. 




MEDB
Oh? And what are you going to do? A girl who's never fought in her life, always relying on her rabid guard dog? You and your army of pathetic men made useless by a curse? 


(EMER turns towards her people to rally them.) 


EMER
OUR HERO IS GONE
BUT ALL IS NOT LOST
CAN’T HE STILL INSPIRE US
AFTER HE PAID THE ULTIMATE COST
TO STAND UP DESPITE OUR WEAKNESS
DESPITE KNOWING THE FUTURE’S BLEAKNESS
WHAT’S A LITTLE PAIN OR LACK OF TRAINING
WE CAN AT LEAST TRY TO NOT SIT IDLY BY
YOU MAY HAVE A CURSE BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH WORSE
TO GIVE UP AND NOT EVEN FIGHT FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN
LET’S MAKE SURE HIS SACRIFICE ISN’T IN VAIN
LET’S TAKE A RISK AND SEE WHAT GROUND WE CAN GAIN


EMER & PEOPLE OF ULSTER
LET’S MAKE SURE HIS SACRIFICE ISN’T IN VAIN
LET’S TAKE A RISK AND SEE WHAT GROUND WE CAN GAIN


(EMER picks up a sword off a dead soldier. Some villagers and Ulster soldiers follow suit.) 


EMER
Charge! 


(The two armies rush at each other. The men of Ulster yell in pain and stumble but keep going. LUGH enters and approaches SETANTA and taps him on the shoulder. SETANTA opens his eyes.) 


SETANTA
Oh. Wow. They're fighting. I wish I could join them. 


LUGH
In a way, you are fighting with them, because it was your example that gave them the motivation to fight. Your spirit of stubborn courage will remain with them. 


SETANTA
So what's next for me? 


LUGH 
I'll be your escort to the afterlife. 


(The Ulster army pushes the Connacht army back until they're all off-stage.) 


SETANTA
Anything special? 


LUGH 
Yes, there is a special place in the Otherworld for warriors who died with glory. I think you'll like it there. By the way, there was someone else I just escorted who was excited to see you there. And he asked me to bring him back here when you die. Is that alright with you? 


SETANTA
Yeah. I'd like to see him too. 


(FERDIAD enters as LUGH motions him in. SETANTA unties himself from the standing stone.) 


FERDIAD
Hey. I'm so sorry for... everything. 


SETANTA
Did dying help clear your head? 


FERDIAD
Yeah, I guess you could say that. But even in the moments just before, all I could think was... 


HOW COULD I LET THIS BE YOUR FINAL MEMORY OF WHAT KIND OF HERO I AM
HOW COULD THIS BE THE WAY OUR STORY ENDS
LIKE IT MEANT NOTHING


SETANTA
No! 


IT MEANT EVERYTHING


AND NOW THEY’LL TELL THE STORY OF US FIGHTING ON OPPOSITE SIDES
AND THAT WILL MAKE US LEGENDS LONG AFTER WE DIED
YOU’RE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
A HERO NEEDS A VILLAIN
WHEN THEY THINK OF ME THEY’LL THINK OF THE TRAGEDY
OF FERDIAD AND CU CHULAINN


FERDIAD
But it doesn't have to be a tragedy anymore, right? 


SETANTA 
Of course. We're out of the spotlight now. Let's enjoy our afterlife. 


LUGH
Wait. I sense another who I might need to escort. 


(EMER enters. Smiling awkwardly, she throws up her hands.) 


EMER
Hey, so, I tried to fight and got killed basically immediately. Did I earn a place with the big boys? 


SETANTA
Sure! 


(SETANTA runs to embrace her. FERDIAD looks on, at first melancholy, but then cracks a smile.) 


EMER
I was never much of a fighter. I couldn't do much. 


SETANTA
You had the selfless courage. That's what matters. 


EMER
Not entirely selfless. Now I don't have to live without you. 


FERDIAD
I'm here too, by the way. Also, I'm really sorry that for a minute I somehow thought attacking you was a good idea. 


EMER
Well, you're not the only one who did, clearly. And that one actually killed me. So relatively speaking, you're not as bad. 


FERDIAD
Okay, if that's how you want to think about it, I won't complain. 


SETANTA
This is the way things are supposed to be. The two people most important to me, no tragic fighting, just a happy afterlife watching our legacy. 


(SETANTA puts his hands on both their shoulders and pulls them closer to himself.) 


LUGH
Are you ready? 


SETANTA
SO THAT WAS MY LIFE
IT WAS SHORT AND GLORIOUS
JUST LIKE I WAS PROMISED
BUT WAS I VICTORIOUS? 


EMER
I THINK YOU WERE
YOU SAW YOUR BLEAK FATE AND TOOK THE REIGNS
AND JUST BEFORE YOU DIED
YOU INSPIRED US TO FIGHT


FERDIAD
AND YOU RISKED IT ALL JUST TO BE REMEMBERED THE RIGHT WAY
YOU CAN COUNT ME AS ONE THAT YOU WON OVER WITH YOUR LAST MINUTE CHANGE


SETANTA
THEN I GUESS I'D SAY I'M SATISFIED
AND I CAN REST EASY ON THE OTHER SIDE
HOPING I DIED WITH A GOOD REPUTATION
AND IT'LL BE A GOOD THING WHEN I COME UP IN CONVERSATION 
NOW IT'S TIME TO ENJOY OUR REWARD OF A WARRIOR'S PARADISE UP ABOVE
JUST US THREE LIKE I WANTED IT TO BE
A SHORT LIFE, A GLORIOUS DEATH


(SETANTA holds both EMER and FERDIAD's hands, which he can do because he has two hands.) 


SETANTA
AND AN AFTERLIFE WITH YOU, MY LOVES


EMER & FERDIAD
AND AN AFTERLIFE WITH YOU, MY LOVE


(The armies come back on, still fighting.) 


PEOPLE OF ULSTER
AND FROM NOW ON WE'LL TELL THE STORY
THAT SPARKED A CHANGE IN OUR HEARTS
AND WE'LL CARRY ON THE STORY
PLAYING OUR OWN PART
STILL FIGHTING THROUGH THE PAIN 
STAYING BRAVE AND NOT SULLEN
AND WE DO IT IN YOUR NAME


PEOPLE OF ULSTER & EMER & FERDIAD & LUGH
OUR HERO CU CHULAINN 


(The End.)
